   <p>Govind R.Dhabolkar alias Annasaheb Dhabolkar alias Hemadpant</p>

<p style="color:white;">
Govind R.Dhabolkar alias Annasaheb Dhabolkar alias Hemadpant is most notably known for being the author of the beloved work the Sri Sai Satcharitra.  He lived in Bandra locality of Mumbai. A self-made man who studied only upto the fifth standard and passed his public service examination, obtaining the post of a Village talati and rising from that humble position to the posts of mamlatdar and first class magistrate by sheer ability. Hemadpant was a Government servant till his last days, his grade being that of a resident magistrate. Before retiring in 1916, he was lucky enough to have contact with Baba.He was a poet by heart and long before he began his noted work, which he started in 1922 with Baba's blessings and completed it in 1926. It was Baba who called him Hemadpant after a well known 13th century poet.
<br>
HEMADPANT MEETING SAI BABA:
<br>
Hemadpant was working in a place called ' Anand' in Gujarat during the year 1910 when Kaka Saheb Dixit wrote a letter to him describing some of the leelas that were peformed by Saibaba. Hemadpant was very impressed with Baba after reading Kaka's letter and wanted to have darshan of Saibaba at the earliest. He applied for leave for 30 days but was rejected by the Commissioner of Southern Division. Then Hemadpant thought that if he gets a transfer from Gujarat to Maharashtra, it would become easier for him to visit Shirdi for Baba's darshan. So he requested the Commissioner for a transfer to Maharashtra. But, the Commissioner refused the request on the grounds that as he had already worked before in Bandra, Mumbai, he could not be posted there once again as per the official rules of the Government. But in the meantime, an unexpected thing happened! Only few days had elapsed since the Commissioner had left for Thane, Maharashtra. Suddenly, the Deputy Collector of Bandra, Mumbai died due to a heart attack. Hence, there was an urgent need of a responsible and trustworthy person for the Bandra Office. The same Commissioner who had earlier denied Hemadpant the transfer to Mumbai, immediately summoned him through a telegram and finally transferred him to Bandra in Mumbai. When he wanted to go and meet Sai Baba in the year 1910, he made up his mind to go by the wrong train. Suddenly a Mohamadan acquaintance of his asked him where he was going. He said he was going to Dadar to catch the Manmad Mail to go to Kopergaon for Shirdi. That gentleman at once corrected him saying that Manmad Mail did not stop at Dadar. He also said, 'you had better go straight to Victoria Terminus and there catch it, for there will be sufficient time for you to get a ticket'. He adopted that advice. If that gentleman had not met him, he would have got disappointed and probably returned home, and his mind would have been tossing again in doubt whether to see Sai Baba or not. So, he himself says, 'Baba's hand has been visible in moulding my fate ever from the beginning'. Then when he first went to Shirdi, he was so very superficial in his attachment to Baba that he fell to a 30 minute discussion with Bala Saheb Bhate, an old friend of his, on the question whether a Guru was necessary or not. Dhabolkar was hotly holding the position that a Guru was unnecessary, and that it was a question of free will of everyone to go whichever way he liked. But Bhate contested his views on both points. Bhate said that there was no free will at all, and that the only thing was destiny. On the question of the need for a Guru, he said, 'A Guru is absolutely essential’. Naturally after 30 minutes' talk they completely disagreed with each other, and there was no result from the discussion except Dhabolkar's mind being restless. After that, they went to the mosque, and when they prostrated before Baba, Baba pointed to Dhabolkar and said, 'What talk was going on there at the wada? And what did this Hemadpant say (pointing his chin to Dhabolkar)?' Dhabolkar's name was not Hemadpant at all. Hemadpant was a great genius, who in the mediaeval age wrote grand works and so, in one way it was a compliment and in the other, the reference to Hemadpant was to mere literary skill. Anyhow Dhabolkar was impressed by the fact that Baba without being told of anything, knew that there was a discussion, and that he (Dhabolkar) had engaged in it with all his literary ability and dialectical skill. However, Baba's influence did not stop with that.
<br>
Dhabolkar had very poor ideas on the subject of saints. For one thing, even frivolous objections to saints weighed largely in his mind. It was well known that Baba's favoured devotee, H. S. Dixit, called Kaka Dixit, was at Shirdi with his daughter, whose life Baba had saved miraculously at Ville Parle when a whole almirah full of toys was about to fall on her. On that occasion Baba said to Dixit (who was with Baba at Shirdi when the child was in danger at Ville Parle) 'Arre Kaka. Tula Kaiji Kazli Maje Sarakarji Ahe'. That is, 'Dixit, why should you have any anxiety? All cares are mine'. On that occasion, when a whole almirah full of toys fell on the child, she was unscathed. She got only a scratch on her arm due to her bangle being broken. Yet that child, when at Shirdi, directly under the nose of Baba, died, Baba could not save her. Then Dhabolkar thought if a Guru cannot save the child of his own pet devotee, what is the good of a Guru?' This appeared to him at that time to be a sound argument, but he adds that destiny proved too much for that argument, and his destiny was to compel him to become a Sai bhakta and get along whatever happened to his arguments about pupils and the nature of help rendered by Gurus to pupils or Sishyas. By constant association with devotees, he got wider and more correct ideas as to the functions of the Gurus. He gradually resigned himself more and more to be dealt with by Baba. Baba dealt with him in a very remarkable way, and from the very beginning, made up his mind as to what should become of this Dhabolkar.
<br>
Dhabolkar had been gathering information about the lilas of Baba and, being a very able writer with great command of Marathi verse and prose, with a good grounding in religious literature, wished to write out a complete study of Baba's lilas, thus forming a good chronicle of Baba. This would be on the lines of Saraswati Gangadhar's Guru Charitra, and would give peace and happiness to people afflicted with sorrows and heavily laden with miseries of worldly existence. This would also give them Jnana or knowledge and wisdom on temporal and spiritual matters. The lilas would be both instructive and interesting like the Vedas, and, if meditated upon, they would bring about laya or union with Brahman and mastery of Yoga and Yoga Ananda. So, he made up his mind that he should collect these stories and treat the publication as his own upasana of his Guru. It would be specially valuable to those who could have no chance of seeing Baba and who would therefore get an idea of Baba through his collection. Baba's teachings and expressions were the outcome of his boundless and natural self-realisation and Baba himself (so Dhabolkar thought), put this idea into his mind to collect and render them as Baba's life or chronicles. Then, he wanted permission for the work. So, Madhav Rao Desphande (known as Shama) was requested to tell Baba, and he told Baba thus: This Anna Saheb wishes to write your life. Don't say that you are a poor begging fakir, and there is no necessity to write your life. But if you agree and help him, he will write or rather your feet (or Grace) will accomplish this work. Without your consent and blessing, nothing can be done successfully'. Baba was moved and blessed Anna Saheb Dhabolkar by giving him udhi and placed his Blessing hand upon Dhabolkar's head, and said,"Let him make a collection of stories and experiences, keeping notes and memos. I will help him. He is only an outward instrument. I should write myself my life, and satisfy the wishes of my devotees. He should get rid of his ego. Place (or surrender) it at my feet. He who acts like this in life, him I will help most. What of my life's stories? I serve him in his house in all possible ways. When his ego is completely annihilated, and there is no trace left of it, I myself shall enter into him and shall myself write my life. Hearing my stories and teachings will create faith in devotees" hearts, and they will easily get self-realization and bliss. But let there be no insistence on establishing one's own view, and no attempt to refute others, opinions of any sort".
<br>
So spoke Baba. Then Dhabolkar made the promise that he would be in that mood and would surrender. His close intimacy with Dixit, Chandorkar and other devotees enabled him to collect plenty of material. This permission was given in 1916, and when Baba passed away, Dhabolkar had hardly written two or three chapters. Most of the work was written after 1918. He wrote 51 or 52 chapters and passed away on 15th July 1929 (ref: Shri Sai Satcharitra, Chapter 53, Ovi 178). Meanwhile his chapters were published in the Sai Leela Masik which was started under his and Dixit's supervision. Gradually people began to read his work and were highly influenced thereby. The effect of the writing was even more on the author himself than on the readers. One effect of it was to completely change his outlook. When earlier he was introduced to Baba, Chinchinikar told Baba that Dhabolkar had a big family and that Baba should bless him to get fresh employment after retirement to maintain his family. Baba said, This cursed Government service he will get. But let him look to my service. That is most important'. And as Baba stated, Dhabolkar got again employed, though only for a short time, but the employment in Baba's service was permanent and grew in intensity from month to month and year to year. His thoughts were upon Baba and his leelas, and the effect was that he was Sai-minded, and Saipossessed. His life and outlook were greatly altered. He felt he was under the protection of Baba and he says, The moment I touched Sai Baba's feet, I began a new lease of life. I felt myself much obliged to those who took me to Baba, and I consider them my real relatives. I cannot repay their debt. I make mental namaskar to them. A peculiarity of Sai Baba's darsan, as I find it, is that by his darsan, our thoughts are changed, the force of previous action (karma) is abated, and gradually non-attachment or dispassion towards worldly objects grows up. It is by the merit of actions in many past births that such a darsan is got. And if only you see Sai Baba, really all the world assumes the form of Sai Baba'.
<br>
First when he went to Baba, he had just a bit of devotion to Baba, and his main nature was still egotistic, combative, and was largely concerned with worldly ambitions. From 1910-16, his progress was hardly noticeable. But in 1917, a change came and he himself sets it out in chapters 18 and 19 of Shri Sai Satcharitra.When he was shampooing Baba's legs, one Mr. Sathe had a problem and that was mentioned to Baba. Sathe was directed by Baba to read Guru Charitra. and he did so for seven days. At the close of it, Baba appeared in a vision (dream) to him with Guru Charitra in his hand. Kaka Dixit came and asked Baba whether he would explain to Sathe what the appearance meant. He asked 'Is he to go on with a second saptaha or study of the Guru Charitra?" Baba said, 'Yes'. Baba also said, 'If the work be studied carefully, the devotee will become pure and will be benefited. The Lord will be pleased and will rescue him from samsara.'. Hearing these words, Anna Dhabolkar (or Hemad Pant) thought, 'For the last seven years (1910-17), I have been serving Baba and never got a vision, and this man, (Mr. Sathe) after a week's stay at Shirdi gets his vision. Like a chataka bird, I am waiting for Baba to pour his nectar on to me and bless me with his instructions’. This was his thought. Baba read his thought at once and told him, 'Go to Shama. Get from him Rs. 15 dakshina, stay and chat with him for a while, and then come back'. Accordingly, he went to Shama and asked for Rs. 15 dakshina: Shama was a very poor man and said, 'I send my 15 namaskars'. Then Hemad Pant said, "I am asked to chat with you and listen to you", Shama then began to tell him the stories of Baba's leelas, and the foremost amongst them that he mentioned was about Mrs. Radhabai Deshmukh.
<br>
Shama said, There was a lady, an old woman, who came to Baba and who was resolved to get mantropadesha from Baba. Baba did not give it. She wanted to try satyagraha. She actually began to fast saying that she would fast unto death at Shirdi unless Baba gave her upadesha. After three days of the fast, I interceded on her behalf, and requested Baba to take pity upon her and give her something. So, Baba sent for her, and told her this. "Mother, why are you subjecting yourself to unnecessary tortures and meeting death. You are my mother and I am your child. Pity me. I will tell you my story. If you listen to it, it will do you good. I had a Guru. He was a very great saint and most merciful. I served him very long indeed. Still he did not whisper any mantra into my ear. I was anxious never to leave him but to stay with him and serve him and receive some instruction from him. But he had his own method. He just got my head shaved and asked me for two pice as dakshina. I gave the same at once. If you ask 'how a perfect Guru could ask for dakshina. and yet be called desireless,' I explain to you that what he asked for was not coins. The first pice that he asked for was Nishta or firm faith and the second pice he wanted was Saburi or patience or perseverance. These two I gave him, and he was pleased. I served my Guru for 12 years. He brought me up. There was no lack of food or clothing. He was full of love. He was Love Incarnate. His love was indescribable. He loved me keenly. Rare is such a Guru. When I looked at him, I was filled with bliss, and he was in bliss. Night and day I gazed at him without thinking of hunger and thirst. Without him, I felt restless. I had no other subject to meditate on. I had nothing but the Guru to attend to He was my sole refuge. My mind was always fixed on him. That 'fixture' is the first pice - nishta. The second pice, saburi, is my waiting patiently and very long on my Guru and serving him. This saburi will take you across samsara. Saburi is manliness in man. It removes all sins and afflictions, gets rid of calamities in various ways, removes all fear and ultimately gives you success. Saburi is a mine of virtues and is the consort of good thought. Nishta and Saburi go together. My Guru never expected anything else from me. But he never neglected me. He always protected me. I lived with him and sometimes away from him. Still I never felt the want or absence of his love. He always protected me by his glance as a tortoise feeds its young ones. Oh, mother, my Guru never taught me any mantra. How can I give you any? Do not try to get mantra or upadesha from anybody. Make me the sole object of your thought and actions, and you will undoubdly attain Paramartha, the spiritual goal of life. Look at me wholeheartedly, and I shall also do the same, that is, look at you wholeheartedly. Sitting in this Masjid, I speak the truth and nothing but the truth. No sadhanas and no proficiency in sastras is necessary. Have faith and confidence in your Guru. Believe fully that the Guru is the sole Actor or Doer. Blessed is he who knows the greatness of his Guru and thinks him to be Hari, Hara, and Brahma, ' Trimurti Incarnate'. Shama said, 'The lady then accepted the advice'.

  <br>

After hearing Shama, Anna Saheb went to the Masjid, and there he sat next to Baba, and when the Aarti was going on, Baba asked him whether he went to Shama and asked for dakshina and had a chat. Dhabolkar said, 'Shama sent his 15 namaskars. In the chat, he gave an account of Mrs. Radhabai Deshmukh's incident'. Baba asked, 'What is it?' Dhabolkar narrated the whole story. Then Baba said, 'Wonderful is the story. Did the story strike you, and did you catch its significance?' Anna Saheb said, 'Yes. The restlessness of my mind has vanished. I have got true peace and come to know the true path'. Then Baba said, 'My method is quite unique. Remember well this one story, and it will be very useful. To get knowledge (realisation) of the self, dhyana (meditation) is necessary. If you practise it continuously, the vrittis (thoughts) will be pacified. Being quite desireless, you should meditate on the Lord who is in all the creatures, and when the mind is concentrated, the goal will be achieved. Meditate always on my formless nature, which is Knowledge Incarnate, Consciousness and Bliss. If you cannot do this, meditate on my form from top to toe as you see here night and day. As you go on doing this, your vrittis will be one-pointed and the distinction between the dhyata (meditator), dhyana (act of meditation) dhyeya (thing meditated upon) will be lost, and the meditator will be one with the consciousness and be merged in Brahman. The mother tortoise is on one bank of the river and her young ones are on the other side. She gives neither milk nor warmth to them. The mere glance gives them nutrition. The young ones do nothing but remember (meditate upon) their mother. The tortoise glance is, to the young ones, a downpour of nectar, the only source of sustenance and happiness. Similar is the relation between the Guru 'and disciples.' Baba gave him sugarcandy and said, 'If you take this story to heart, remember it well, your state will be equally sweet. Your desires will be fulfilled and you will be happy. Meditate on the story; assimilate its spirit; then you will always remember and meditate on the Lord who will manifest himself to you.'
<br>
Hemad Pant was lucky enough to get a Government job for a short while, and thereafter he acted upon Baba's advice that he should serve Baba. So, he helped greatly in the management of Sai Baba's Sansthan, after 1918 or 1920-21. He looked after the accounts and helped greatly in the publication of Sai Leela Masik also. But his most important service was the writing of the first 51 or 52 chapters of the Sai Satcharitra. After his death in 1929, the 53rd chapter was added on and the complete book has been published. It is a monument of masterly, sonorous, Marathi verse, picturing Sai Baba's leelas and setting forth Baba's uetterances and conduct in a way that would always be remembered. So, the effect of the study of Baba's leelas is the great service Hemadpant renders. Baba himself said that a study of his leelas would put an end to ignorance and ferry people across samsara. It would make them get laya (absorption) in Sai by constantly remembering his leelas, words, and nature, especially his nature as sarvantaryami. Baba, as he himself declared, is the soul of all souls. Every thing is his form. By constant meditation on Baba's leelas, one can get an experience of Baba in all forms.
<br>
Baba agreed to look after the temporal welfare as well as the spiritual welfare of Dhabolkar. The reality of this protection and guarding influence not only in his case but also in those of his relations, Dhabolkar noted time and again. Having found Baba a precious gem or mine, he took with him to Baba his two sons-in-law, one after another (R. R. Samant and Galwankar) as also the rest of his family. Baba looked after their interests as well as can be seen in Devotees' Experiences of Sai Baba. Galwankar's statement is specially interesting. He stated in 1938 when he was still in official harness that Baba fixed him birth after birth on the high moral and spiritual level of truth and integrity and provided satisfactorily for all his wants. Once Baba appeared to Galwankar and asked him "What do you want?" Galwankar wanted nothing but Baba's grace and he got it. He used to get sudden spells of bliss of Baba. In the midst of his official work he would suddenly stop and for some moments he would be enjoying the bliss of Baba, His services to Sai Baba are his gift of sites, etc. and what he did when appointed as trustee of Sai Sansthan, an office which he held upto his death in 1945. The benefits to other relations are not recorded by Dhabolkar or others, but some of the benefits to Dhabolkar himself have been recorded.
<br>
HOUSE OF DHABOLKAR ALIAS HEMADPANT “SAI NIWAS”
<br>
Hemadpant’s Simga Dinner (Full Moon Day – Holi Festival Day) (Refer Sai Satcharitra Chapter 40) was performed in this very house. This house is well maintained and kept “as is” with all the memorablia. This house was built in 1911 at Bandra (W), Mumbai.

<br>
STAIRCASE
<br>
The members of the family were about to start eating, when the footsteps were heard on these Stairs. Dhabolkar went immediately and opened the door and saw Ali Mohammed and Moulana Isnu Mujawar with a packet.

<br>
THE POTHI
<br>
After Dhabolkar was transferred to Bandra, Mumbai as per the rules of the Government his pending leave request was also sanctioned and thus he was able to plan his trip to Shirdi for Baba's darshan.
<br>
In 1910, when Dhabolkar first came to Shirdi, he saw Baba grinding wheat, only to spread them around the borders of Shirdi village to stop the cholera epidemic. His curiosity aroused and he wished with all his heart to write "Shri Sai Satcharitra", the life history of Baba. He sought the permission of Madhav Rao Deshpande alias Shama and it was granted. Sai Baba told him: "You have my full consent to write my life history. Take notes and keep them. If my leelas are recorded, sins committed through ignorance will be dissolved. When my leelas are heard and/or read with love and devotion, the cares and troubles of worldly life will be forgotton.". Thus, Hemadpant started recording, hearing, seeing the leelas of His Guru. With love and devotion he kept a record of them.
<br>
Thus, Dhabolkar started writing the “Shri Sai Satcharitra” in the year 1910. Baba gave his final consent in the year 1916 to write His Biography. Hence by the time Baba took Mahasamadhi, Hemadpant had barely written two or three chapters. Most of his work was written after 1918. He actually started wiriting "The Pothi" in 1922 and it was published in the year 1929 after Hemadpant took Samadhi. This is a composition of 9308 verses in Marathi in Ovi Meter, on the life and teachings of Saibaba on the lines of Eknath's Bhagwat. It is usually sung rather than read. This Pothi should be in every house, and should be lovingly and respectfully read. Baba will be pleased by removing ignorance and poverty, will give knowledge, wealth and prosperity. With a concentrated mind if one reads at least a Chapter daily, it will give unbounded happiness. This work should be read at home specifically on “Gurupurnima”  and on other holy days. If you study this one book all your desires will be satisfied and Sai will easily make you cross this “Bhava Sagara”. The sick will get health, poor will get wealth and the mind will get steadiness (Refer Sai Satcharitra Phalastuti, Epilogue).
<br>
On 26th November 1930, the first edition of "Shri Sai Satcharitra" was published in Marathi by Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust (Shirdi) and had approximately 900 pages in size 8'x5.5' and was priced at Rs.3/- only. Later this holy pothi got translated into English,Telugu,Tamil,Gujarati,Sindhi, Bengali,Kannada,Oria,Nepali,Punjabi and Konkani languages.

THE DESK
<br>
This is the desk on which Dhabolkar wrote the Sai Satcharitra. The place used to be in the corner of the prayer room just below the original photo of Saibaba. On this desk, he spent many loving hours writing about the Leelas of Baba and thus gave us Ambrosia.
<br>
BABA’S MURTI
<br>
This Murti is used for meditating on, and his “life like eyes” sees through and through you. Many leelas of this Murti are stated by Mrs.Dhabolkar.
<br>
SIMGA DINNER PHOTO
<br>
On the early morning of full moon day of the festival of Holi in the year 1917, Hemadpant had a vision. Sai Baba appeared to him in his dream in the form of a Saint and told him that he would come to his house for meals that day. When he worke up he did not see Saibaba or any Saint. Though Hemadpant was in contact with Baba for the last 7 years and though he always meditated on Baba, he never experienced that Baba would come to his house for meals. However, he went to his wife Smt.Rukumabai and informed her that being the festival of Holi, a saint guest was coming for meal and that some more rice should be prepared. When she further enquired about the guest, Hemadpant told her all about the dream. She doubtingly asked whether it was possible that Baba should come to Bandra from Shirdi, leaving the delicious food served to Him in Shirdi for accepting their ordinary meals. Hemadpant then assured her that Baba might not come in person but He might attend in the form of a guest and that they would not lose anything by cooking some extra rice. After, this preparation for the dinner went on and it was ready by the afernoon.
<br>
The worship was done and the dishes were arranged with "Rangoli" marks around them. Two rows were put up with a central seat between them for the guest. The full family assembled and occupied their seats and the serving of various dishes commenced. While this was being done, everybody was watching for the guest, but none turned up though it was past noon. The door was then closed and the ghee was served. Formal offering of the Naivedyam to Lord Krishna was also done. But, as they were about to begin, foot-steps in the staircase were distinctly heard.
<br>
Hemadpant went immediately and opened the door and saw two men Ali Mohammed and Moulana Isnu Mujavar. These two person, seeing that meals were ready and all the members were about to begin eating, apologized to Hemadpant and requested him to excuse their interference. They said "You left your seat and came running to us, others are waiting for you. Hence, please take this thing and we shall relate all the wonderful tale about it later on at your convenience." So saying they took out a packet wrapped in an old newspaper cover and placed it on the table. Hemadpant uncovered the packet and saw, to his great wonder and surprise, a big nice picture of Sai Baba. Seeing it, he was much moved, tears rolled down from his eyes, he bent and placed his head on the feet of Baba in the picture. He felt blessed by Baba. Out of curiosity he asked Ali Mohammed where he got this picture. He said that he bought it from a shop and that he would give all the details about it later on and wished that as all the members were waiting for him, he should go and join them for food. Hemadpant thanked him, bade them good-bye and returned to the dining hall. The picture was placed on the central seat reserved for the guest. After offering Naivedyam to the photograph of Sai Baba, the whole family commenced eating food.
<br>
At Shirdi, the same day and at the same time Sai Baba told Shama that he had a stumptuous meal at Bandra in Hamadpant's house. Shama could understand Baba's words only after sometime when Hemadpant came to Shirdi to meet Baba.
<br>
The story of how this photograph of Baba reached Hemadpant's Sai Niwas is very interesting: Llong time back, a saint by name Abdul Rehman gave a lifesize framed photo of Sai Baba to Ali Mohammed. After sometime, Ali's brother-in-law fell sick. Someone suggested that if the photos of saints were put in the sea, the illness would subside. Hence, Ali asked his manager to collect all such photographs from his/relative's house and put them in the sea. After some days Ali Mohammed came home and was
 surprised to find that Baba's photograph was still there on the wall. He began to think to whom it should be given and then as per Baba's order given to him through his thoughts, the photo was handed over to Hemadpant.
<br>
This beautiful photograph that was brought by Ali Mohammed and Moulana Isnu Mujawar was set in the place that was reserved for Baba at the “Simga Dinner” (Refer Sai Satcharitra Chapter 40). Baba kept his promise to attend the Dinner in the dream of Dhabolkar and arrived in this form.

BABA’S PORTRAIT
<br>
This beautiful portrait of Baba was painted by Shyamrao Jaykar on 26th December 1916. It is dated and signed.“Baba sitting on Stone” posture is on the left wall just upon entering the house. It is a masterpiece, luminous, pensive and most of all forgiving. Many wondrous things are happening to this photo. Painted some 80 years ago one can see a “Shesha Nag” behind Baba, but most interestingly a “Swastik” on Baba’s chest. It looks like as if someone made a “Chandan Swastik”. There is another “Swastik” on Baba’s right foot. <br>
