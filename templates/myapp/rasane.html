 (He did lot of  propaganda  about  Baba’s  mission and  miracles and was also a trustee in Shirdi Sai Baba Sansthan for some time and  served  Baba in that capacity also.  He  also took over  their family  bangle  business  and  named  the  firm as,"Sri Samartha Sainath & Co." and  conducted  the business on  fair principles.)
<br>
   Dattatreya    Damodar    Rasane    alias    Nana    Sahib   Rasane (or Daulatshah), Son of Damodar (or Anna) Savalram Rasane, Kasar was  a resident of Poona and  his  father  was  an  ankita  devotee  of Sai Baba. His  father,  Savalram Rasane  went  to Shirdi  in 1895.  He  was  one  of   the  oldest  devotees  who  visited  Shirdi at a time when  Nana Saheb  Chandorkar  went  to Shirdi  to have  darshan of Baba.. At that time,  Savalram   did  not  have  any  issue  even  though  he  had  two  wives.   On contacting  famous  astrologers,   Savalram  came  to   know that  due  to  adverse planetary position  in his  horoscope he  would not  get any issue at all.  However,  he  came  to  know about the miracles of  Baba  and  then  decided  to  visit  Shirdi. So his father went to Shirdi to have datshan of Baba and seek  his  blessings for  getting  issue.  At  that  time  in  1895,  a devotee  had sent Baba  a parcel  of excellent  Goa mangoes. After distributing the mangoes among the  children  present  in  the masjid, Baba kept 8 mangoes separately for giving to  Savalram  who was still  on  the  way  to  Shirdi. The children wanted Baba to distribute even these eight mangoes also;  but  Baba  said  that he  reserved  them  for  Damya (Baba used to call Savalram as Damya). But they said, 'Damya  is  not  here'.  Then  Baba  said  that  Damya  was  on  his  way  to  Shirdi and  arrived  already  at  Kopergaon  and   would   be  in  Shirdi   shortly.  Immediately  after that, Damya reached Shirdi for  the  first  time and  then went to the masjid  and  had  darshan of  Baba after presenting Baba with flower garlands, chadar etc. Then Baba gave the fruits  and  asked  him to give them to his  junior wife. Baba  also  said  that  he  would  have  two  sons   first.   Baba also  gave  the  names of  the  first  two sons  as  Daulat  Shah  for  the  first  son and Thana Shah for the second  son. Savalram immediately noted the names  in a note book.  He   then returned to his home at  Ahmednagar and gave the fruits to his junior wife. One  year after his visit to  Shirdi, a son  was  born. When  the child  was 15 months old, his father took  him  to  Baba  at Shirdi  for darshan and  he  then  asked  Baba, "How  shall  I  name  this  child?" Baba replied, "Have you forgotten what I told you? You  have written it at  page 3 of your note book. Did I not say that he should be named Daulat Shah?" He was thus  named Daulat Shah and besides this name, he also had Hindu name as Dattatreya Damodar Rasane.
   <br>
   In 1900 when he was five years old, his father took him to Shirdi for his tuft ceremony At that time Baba held his hand and wrote on the slate and he was thus initiated into the mysteries of the alphabet and he was also taken to the school in Shirdi.
   <br>
   When he was aged about seven years old, he was in Shirdi and was massaging Baba's foot. At that time Baba began the distribution of sweets with his own hand to the children present in the masjid. Being a young boy, naturally his attention was drawn towards the sweets and then he became slack in massaging. His mother who was by his side, observed this and beat him and also said that he was thinking about sweets and neglecting the service to Baba. Then Baba said, "You, old woman. Why do you beat the boy?". His mother then requested Baba to give him and develop in him a good desire to perform service to Baba. Baba replied, "The boy will serve me well. God will endow him with pure desires. Do not fear, Do not beat him". Later when the boy grew up in age, he did lot of propaganda about Baba’s mission and miracles and he was also a trustee in Shirdi Sai Baba Sansthan for some time and served Baba in that capacity also.
   <br>
   When he was twelve years old, he went with an elder cousin to Shirdi. They both had 100 rupees with them. Baba asked for dakshina, starting with 10 rupees, next 15 rupees etc. Only 25 rupees were left with his cousin in his pocket and then they at once wrote to their people in Ahmednagar for sending more money so that they could offer Baba for dakshina and also for their return journey. That evening Baba again asked his cousin for another 25 rupees and he replied that the money they had, had been exhausted and that they required money for their return journey. Baba immediately replied saying, "Why talk all this humbug? You have got 25 rupees in a corner of your pocket. The M.O. you have written for, will come here tomorrow. Do not fear". His cousin immediately gave 25 rupees as dakshina. Baba used to say that any one giving an amount as dakshina, Baba would definitely return to that person not less than double the amount of dakshina. Baba would thus bless the devotees by returning to them several times the dakshina amount he was receiving.
   <br>
   When he was to be married, four girls were offered to him. His father never acted in any important matter without consulting and getting the sanction of Baba. He went to Baba and placed before him all the four horoscopes of the girls offered, one of which offered as dowry Rs.2,500 or 3,000 and asked Baba which girl was to be chosen. Baba selected a poor girl's horoscope and gave it into the hands of his father. That was the girl he married and his marriage took place in Pandharpur. His father invited Baba to attend the marriage. But Baba replied, "I am with you. Do not fear. Whenever you think of me, there I am with you". My father pressed him further to attend the marriage. Baba, however, declined the invitation but asked Shama to attend it on his behalf. And Shama attended his marriage at Pandharpur.
   <br>
   He had an younger brother and he was named as Thana Shah as per the directions of Baba. As regards Dattatreya’s children, two girls and a boy were born but expired within a few months of their birth owing to fits. The male child died in 1926, his wife's health was also bad and consequently he was in great depression of spirits and in that state he prayed to Baba thus: "Instead of giving me many babies that die quickly give me at least one child that will live long". When he was sleeping in the wada in Shirdi, Baba appeared in his dream and said that the male child for which he was grieving over was born in Moola Nakshatra and that was harmful to the parents. He saw in that dream a bright circle like the Sun on Baba's breast. Or rather inside the Sun, Baba was sitting with his deceased child on his lap and Baba said, "I took away this dangerous child from you. I will give you a good child. Do not fear". Before this time his family had migrated from Ahmednagar to Poona. When he went home he verified the dead child's horoscope and noticed that Moola was really the constellation under which the child was born.
   <br>
   His faith in Baba increased manifold and he looked upon other saints as Baba..and while bowing to them, he used to utter internally the name of Sadguru Samartha Sainath.. In 1927 when he visited Khedgaonpet and bowed to Narayan Maharaj with this type of expression on his lips, that Maharaj told him that his Guru was Parama Guru (Supreme Guru) and that Baba was of higher order than himself and also asked him as to why he had come there. That Maharaj also said that his choice of Baba as Guru was excellent and that he would achieve his purpose in his life.
   <br>
   In 1927 his stars were not auspicious and his health was deteriorating. He went up to the temple of Sitaram Uttareswar (a Siva temple) near Junner (about 40 miles away from Poona) and worshipped at the temple every Sunday. One Sunday at 9 p.m. when he placed flowers on the Idol with the words, “Namaskar (Salutation) to Sai Baba”, he saw a light at the Idol and in that light also saw the Image of Sai Baba, about whom he was always thinking. Then his health improved and his depressed spirits suddenly got revived. A saint by name Janaki Das, was living in that area. Every Sunday he used to go and bow to him while remembering internally about Baba and also uttering internally Baba’s name. The saint then told him, "You have resorted to a great saint. Why do you come to a poor saint like me? People like myself seize the feet of Sai Baba”.
   <br>
   Then he went to his lodgings and slept and during that night, Baba appeared in his dream and said, "You are full of anxiety. Give me biksha, your entire body and mind as biksha".
   He said, “I will give this biksha and then inform my father”.
   Then Baba said, “How can you do it without consulting your father?”
   He then said, “I am master of my life. My father has other sons and he will not object. You gave the children and there can be no objection to my being given to you”.
   Then Baba lifted up his body in his palms and placed him into his breast pocket. He was filled with ecstasy at the thought that Baba exhibited so much kindness to him by putting him near his heart. When he woke up he found himself very happy and his mind at once attained detachment or Vairagya. Thereafter he felt that he had changed mentally also and that material things did not attract him from that time onwards as they did earlier..
   <br>
   After a few months, a son was born to him when they were at Pandharpur and the son was named Phalgun Vadya and this had happened in 1928. After fifteen months, he and his father went to Shirdi and his father prayed to Baba at Baba’s Mahasamadhi for granting him one more son. Baba granted it and he got another son in 1931. On the second day of this son’s birth, the child developed high fever and he gave Baba's udhi and tirtha to the child and a talisman with cloth relics of Baba was also tied to the child and the child recovered fully. This son was named as Saidas. On completion of Saidas’s first year, Saidas was taken to Shirdi and abhishek was performed, clothes were offered to Baba’s Mahasamadhi and meals were arranged for Brahmins as a sign of gratitude to Baba..
   <br>
   During 1931 he was placed in charge of their family bangle business and for that business he insisted that the firm should be named after Baba and for that purpose, chits were cast before Baba’s picture to seek Baba’s permission. After obtaining Baba’s permission in this way, the firm was named as Sri Samartha Sainath & Co. The business was conducted by him on the lines of probity and conscience.
   <br>
   Whenever people approached him for Baba’s udhi and tirtha, he was eagerly and happily offering them and they were being blessed by Baba and their illness was cured and their problems got resolved as he was giving them in the name of Baba.
   <br>
   In September, 1932 he was on a pilgrimage at Muttra and at that time he had such a severe attack of cholera that death appeared almost imminent. His father also asked him what was his last wish. Then he said that he wanted to be taken to Shirdi for being burnt there in the event of his death as Baba was Lord Krishna. But with Baba's photo placed over his head and also Baba's udhi and tirtha was given to him, there was some improvement in his health. On that day during the midnight, a saint of Unava by name Miradatar, a renowned Muslim Saint, near Sidpur in Gujarat spoke through his sister-in-law, Subadra Bai through an avesam. The spirit of that saint spoke through her mouth, saying that Baba was his uncle and Baba sent him to tell them that they should not have any fear about the health of Dattatreya who was having Baba’s blessings and asked them to give a cup of coffee to the patient and that he would be alright. Then he took coffee adding in it Baba’s udhi. After a little while, his fever and motions got stopped. Thus from his critical position, he got cured and this had created a surprise in the mind of the treating doctor and he told the doctor that Baba was Doctor of Doctors and that Baba’s sacred udhi protected and saved him. The portrait of Dattatreya Damodar Rasane was also kept along with the portraits of other close devotees in the Samadhi Mandir.
   <br>
   He was also interviewed by B.V.Narasimhaswamiji in 1936 and he expressed all these details in that interview and consequently all these details and his miraculous experiences with Baba thus came to light.
<br>another source says: <br>
   My father is an old devotee of Sai Baba. He went to Baba about the time Nana Saheb Chandorkar went to him. Then my father had no issue and wanted to go to Baba to get his blessings for obtaining issue. About 1895, a devotee had sent Baba a parcel of excellent Goa mangoes. Of these he kept apart six and distributed the rest as prasad to persons present. They wanted him to distribute the remaining six also. But Baba said he had reserved some for Damya (i.e., my father). But they said, 'Damya is not here'. "He has arrived at Kopergaon and will be here soon", said Baba. Soon after that, my father went to Baba and presented him with flower garlands, chadar etc. Then Baba said "Damya! Take these fruits now. Eat and die". My father was frightened at these words. But Mahalsapathi who was there told him that it was a bless­ing to die at Baba's feet. Thus encouraged, my father thought he would eat the fruit. But Baba came to his relief with these words, "Do not eat the fruits yourself. But give them to your junior wife. You will have two sons first. You should name the first Daulat Shah and the second Thana Shah", etc. My father returned to his home at Ahmednagar and gave the fruits to his junior wife. He then noted the names to be given to the promised sons in a note book. One year after that, I was born. When I was 15 months old my father took me to Sai Baba at Shirdi for darsan and he then asked Baba, "How shall I name this child?" Baba replied, "Have you forgotten what I told you? You have written it at page 3 of your note book. Did I not say that he should be named Daulat Shah?"
   <br>
   In my fifth year (i.e., in 1900) I was taken to Shirdi for my tuft ceremony and given my first initiation into the mysteries of the Alphabet. Sai Baba held my hand and wrote on the slate etc. Thereafter I was taken to the school at Shirdi. When I was to be married, four girls were offered to me. My father never acted in any serious matter without previously consulting and getting the sanction of Baba. He went to Sai Baba and placed before Him all the four horoscopes (i.e., of the offered girls) one of which had 2,500 or 3,000 rupees dowry and asked Him which was to be chosen. Baba selected a poor girl's horoscope and gave it into the hands of my father. That was the girl I married. My father invited Baba to attend the marriage which was to take pace at Pandharpur. But Baba replied, "I am with you. Do not fear. Whenever you think of me, there I am with you". My father pressed him further to attend the marriage. Baba, however, declined the invitation with these words: "Without God's permission nothing can be done by me. I will send Shama (i.e., Madhav Rao) to attend it as my deputy". And Shama attended it at Pandharpur.
   <br>
   I have a younger brother and he was named according to directions of Baba.
   <br>
   As for the issue of my marriage, two girls and a boy were born but expired within a few months of their birth owing to fits. The male child died in 1926, my wife's health was bad and I was in great depression of spirits and in that state I prayed to Him thus: "Instead of giving me many babies that die quickly give me at least one child that will live long". When I was sleeping there at Shirdi, Baba appeared in my dream and said that the male child I was grieving over was born in Moola Nakshatra (i.e., under the constellation Moola) and that was harmful to the parents. I saw in that dream a bright circle like the Sun on Baba's breast. Or rather inside the Sun, Baba was sitting with my deceased child on his lap and he said, "I took away this dangerous child from you. I will give you a good child. Do not fear". Before this time our family had migrated from Ahmednagar to Poona. When I went home I looked up the dead child's horoscope and noticed that Moola was really the constellation under which the child was born. In fifteen months of the visit I got a son who is still alive. This was in 1918.
   <br>
   My faith in Sai Baba increased. I look upon other Saints as Sai Baba and when I bow to them, I say either expressly or within myself, "I bow to Sadguru Samartha Sainath". In 1927 I visited Khedgaonpet and bowed to Narayan Maharaj with this thought or these words. He told me, "Your guru is Paramaguru. He is of higher sort than myself. Why did you come here? Your prarabdha – Sanchida - is there. Your choice is excellent. Go there and you will achieve your purpose". This was before the birth of the son I referred to in the last paragraph.
   <br>
   In 1927 my stars were not auspicious and my health was bad. I went up to the temple of Sitaram Uttareswar (i.e., Siva) 2 miles of Junner (about 40 miles from Poona) and worshiped the God every Sunday. One Sunday at 9 p.m. when I placed flowers on the God with the words, 'Namaskar (i.e., Salutation) to Sai Baba', I saw a light at the image of the God and in that light the form as Sai Baba, whom I am always thinking of. Then my health improved and my drooping spirits revived. A saint, Janaki Das, is living there. Every Sunday I went and bowed to Him also with Sai Baba's name on my lips. He then told me, "You have resorted to a great saint. Why do you come to a poor saint like me? People like myself seize the feet of Sai Baba.” Then I went to my lodgings and slept. Sai Baba appeared in my dream as a fakir and said, "You are full of anxiety. Give me biksha, your entire body and mind as biksha".
