SWAMI  KESAVAIAHJI
<br>
(Kesavaiah entered suddenly a different phase in his life and was not attracted to spiritual discipline and there was no spiritual urge in him in about 1939. He even went to the extent of questioning how God could be dwelling in stone-idols. He preferred charity to the poor, to temple worship. After worshipping Lord Subrahmanya at Palani, he then realised that idols in temples were not mere stones but were the true manifestations of the Lord Himself.  One night Baba appeared in his dream for a few minutes and  then onwards, he became a staunch devotee of Baba.)
<br>
Sri Kesavaiah was born on 1st of July, 1899 as the second of the four children to a Vaishnavaite couple, Sri Balaiah and Smt. Sanjeevamma who were devoted to  Lord Sri Rama. He was born on Sravana Bahula Amavasya day and the traditional belief at that time was that such a boy born on that day would either become a sadhu or a thief  and consequently his parents were anxious. During his childhood, young Kesavaiah was brought up in a religious atmosphere with the daily reading of the Mahabharata, the Ramayana and theBhagavata. The family lived at Pamidi in Andhra Pradesh on the banks of the sacred river Pennar which was sanctified in the past by the presence of several great saints and homas performed by saints and there are several ancient temples in and around that place. However, some astrologers predicted and assured the agitated parents that their son would surely become a great sadhu.  Over a period of time, his parents observed that young Keshavaiah started showing signs of affinity towards religious matters and with this development, his parents started feeling happy.  Even during his younger age, he used to spend several hours in rapt meditation in the nearby temples.Image 006
<br>
While at the middle school where he was studying, he was drawn to his teacher by name  Lekklar with whom he spent lot of time and stood first in the Bible classes, after having learnt about Jesus Christ.  Even at his younger age, he was blessed with a divine vision of Jesus Christ. Similarly he was also attracted to a Muslim who used to tell him about Prophet Mohammad and his teachings. After some time, he was also lucky to have the vision of Prophet Mohammad. He did not evince much interest in playing with other boys.  He was avoiding chit chatting and other gossip. He was also not particular of going after sweets and other daintees. He was totally a different child right from his childhood.
<br>
In due course, he became proficient in prophecy and his teacher, Lekklar was stated to have observed that Kesavaiah predicted about the end of the British rule, after some years, in India. At a time when the name of Congress Party was not known prominently in India, he hinted at his prophecy that the Congress Party would rule India for a long time.
<br>
During Oct, 1918, when Sri Sai Baba shed his mortal coil and went into Mahasamadhi, about that time he and his mother Sanjeevamma were both unwell. And on that day his mother passed away. Strangely enough there was a wild rumour in the village that Kesavaiah had passed away. From that day onwards Kesavaiah’s health rapidly improved tremendously.
<br>
After completing his high school studies at Ananthapur,  Kesavaiah joined as a clerk in the District Registar’s Office at Anantapur in 1923, and within a year, he was married to a girl named Govindamma. After ten years, he was promoted as the Sub-Regisitrar in 1933. As an official, he had won the respect of everyone by his honesty and competence. He was against uttering any lie and did not utter a lie. He was against accepting any bribe. He was known for his honesty and fearlessness. At the same time, he was also equally kind and sympathetic in his duties towards the poor.
<br>
He entered suddenly a different phase in his life and was not attracted to spiritual discipline. There was no spiritual urge in him in about 1939. He looked fully westernized in his dress, habits and ideas as any other young man of his age at that time. He even went to the extent of questioning how God could be dwelling in stone-idols. He was also against offering of coconuts in temples as he felt that it would be of no use. He also felt that the money that was used in performing religious rituals, could be better used for the welfare of the poor. Thus he became a non believer in temple worship and idolatry. He preferred charity to the poor, to temple worship. That was his philosophy and mental outlook at that time.
<br>
Such people were suddenly drawn to spiritual matters in unexpected circumstances. In later part in 1939, his elder daughter was seriously unwell. His well wishers advised him to go on a pilgrimage and visit some temples. Accordingly, he started on his pilgrimage commencing from holy Rameswaram in the South. He visited the temples at Rameswaram, Srirangam, Madurai and Kanchi  and there was no change in his outlook except that he was attracted by the sculpture and architecture of the temples. He next visited the temple of Lord Subrahmanya at Palani which brought about some radical change in his outlook, bringing him towards spiritual matters.
<br>
After worshipping Lord Subrahmanya at Palani, he closed his eyes and bowed to the deity with unswerving devotion. On opening the eyes, he saw a flood of divine light in the place of and also around the idol and was thrilled and impressed by the flood of divine light. He had derived lot of ecstasy due to the sight of the flood light around the idol.  At the height of his ecstasy, he lost all his consciousness for some time. After some time, he felt extremely weak. Later when he visited again Rameswaram, he experienced at that time, ecstasy when he looked at the idol of Lord Ramalingeswara.
<br>
He then realized that the  idols in temples were not mere stones but were the true manifestations of the Lord Himself. These two mystic ecstatic experiences opened up the dormant mystic power in him.
<br>
With passage of time, it looked as though he was endowed with some mystic powers which would enable him to clearly see any body’s past, present and future on seeing any one. But whenever on seeing any person, if he happened to visualize his bad future, he could not control himself but used to immediately caution him about his bad future  and also advise him about the remedial measures to avert that bad future. Such was his kindness towards fellow persons.
<br>
He returned to Dharmavaram from his pilgrimage in May 1939.  Thereafter he had vision of Sri Sai Baba and was lucky to have Baba’s darshan in the vision.  He heard about Sri Sai Baba for the first time from Sri M.Malli Reddy, a famous lawyer in Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh. Sri Malli Reddy used to visit frequently Dharmavaram where Kesavaiah was working and both knew each other very well. Sri Malli Reddy was a devotee of Sri Sai Baba since a long time and knew Kesavaiah from 1930. But somehow, there was no occasion for Sri Malli Reddy to raise the topic about the greatness of Baba and  inform Kesavaiah about Baba, his mission and miracles. In 1939, one day Kesavaiah accompanied Sri Malli Reddy to the railway station to see him off and was telling Sri Malli Reddy about his innumerable problems till the departure of the train. Sri Malli Reddy then suggested suddenly to Kesavaiah to visit Shirdi, pray to Baba and start worshipping Baba for getting all his problems solved. In those days Baba’s greatness was not so well known in all parts of the country and Kesavaiah  himself had never heard of him earlier.
<br>
But ever since he heard the name of Baba he went on thinking who that Baba was. He and his wife decided to worship Baba’s picture. That night Baba appeared in his dream for a few minutes. The next day when he was still thinking of writing for a picture of Baba, he received a Baba’s photo surprisingly from the Sai Baba Sansthan, Shirdi. And after two days he also received a packet of udi. How could the Sansthan know about Kesavaiah and his address.  How could they send him the photo and udi too. It was too short a time for Sri Malli Reddy to have written to the Sansthan on his behalf for this purpose. So he felt that undoubtedly this was the miracle of Baba.
<br>
The next day, when he was putting on his usual western dress before going to his office, Kesavaiah heard a mysterious voice, “Why all this show for you?” This brought about a strong transformation in him and he immediately switched over to the use of the traditional dhoti dress. All his colleagues in the office wondered at the sudden transformation in his dress.
<br>
About this time he again met Sri Malli Reddy who was pleasantly surprised to hear about Kesavaiah’s dream experience. He said, “You are blessed indeed. Not every one can have the darshan of Baba even in a dream. Undoubtedly you must have been his devotee in your previous life.” Henceforth Kesavaiah started worshipping Baba with utmost devotion. Within a short time all his troubles got solved and vanished, perhaps with Baba’s Grace.
<br>
In April, 1941, he came to Penukonda in Andhra Pradesh on transfer. Besides his daily puja to Baba, he used to perform special puja to Baba on every Thursday and at the puja time on Thursdays, large crowds were assembling for seeking help from Baba through him. He acquired marvelous powers with Baba’s Grace and used to foretell events with mathematical accuracy and cure their diseases. He was having Baba’s picture only in his puja room and used to look at the photo of Baba before telling all this information. He was so popular during that time that he was  getting several letters from far off people, explaining their problems and requesting for solutions through Baba’s Grace. He used to keep all such letters before Baba’s photo and thereafter he was sending replies to all such people. It is gathered that he had received as many as 2000 letters from different people within a period of about 16 months and that all such letters were replied by him promptly, indicating solutions to their problems. In view of all these developments, he was being addressed as Samiji Kesavaiah or Swami Kesavaiahji.
<br>
There were many other remarkable experiences he had. When he visited Shirdi in 1943 he had a wish to go to Pandharpur. He cast chits to know Baba’s views in the matter. As the response was in the affirmative, he proceeded on his journey. A stranger met him at Dhond and accompanied him to Pandharpur and took him to a choultry in a tonga. He even paid for the conveyance. After making all the necessary arrangements, he said to Kesavaiahji, “Whenever you think of me I shall come to you.” And then he went away. It is not necessary to tell that Baba only came to him in the shape of a stranger.
<br>
In 1948, Kesavaiahji was instrumental in getting a temple constructed for Sai Baba in Penukonda. He continued his service to Baba and used to offer Baba’s blessings to the visitors. Then he became unwell due to tuberculosis in 1948 and came to Chennai and stayed there for medical treatment.   Inspite of his illness he went on curing the sick by offering the udhi from Shirdi. Doctors who examined him found that his left lung had collapsed and there were no chances of his survaval.  Kesavaiahji himself gave up the hope of his recovery and made all arrangements for the subsistence of his family in the event of any calamity of his impending demise. He lay on his bed calmly, looking at the Baba’s picture with unswerving devotion. On 29th April, 1949, in the morning, Kesavaiahji clearly saw in a vision that the attendants of Death were entering his room. With courage, he said to them, “You may take me away after securing the permission of Sai Baba!” Immediately Baba appeared before him and drove them out. Thereafter Kesavaiahji’s condition rapidly improved. Dr. Veera Reddy who was regularly treating him, had remarkable experience at Kesavaiahji’s unexpected sudden recovery and he also started developing faith in Baba. Thus he recovered very well with Baba’s Grace.
<br>
From 1949 onwards, he used to perform on every Thursday puja to Baba in “Sai Nilayam” in Shenoy Nagar in Chennai. Over a period of time, several devotees used to visit “Sai Nilayam” and he was offering to them Baba’s udhi received from Shirdi for their welfare. Kesavaiahji used to touch the forehead of each person and apply udhi there simultaneously blessing each one of them and this process resulted in mystically solving their problems.  B.V.Narasimha Swamiji also appreciated Kesavaiahji’s service to the devotees in predicting the coming events accurately and offering solutions for their problems. Over a period of time, Kesavaiahji had acquired some spiritual powers and siddhis. He visited Shirdi as many as 73  times. In spite of all these developments, he was  simple and unostentatious in his approach. By being a Grihastha, a family man, he practiced and demonstrated that it was possible to receive Baba’s Grace and become a Swamiji who could help people to tide over their problems.
<br>
In due course, “Sai Nilayam” in Shenoy Nagar became an important spiritual centre. During 1959, Sri Sai Baba Bhaktha Samajam came into existence and became a registered body with Swamiji as the Founder-President. In March, 1975, Sai Baba Mandir with meditation hall along with magnificent edifice was inaugurated in Shenoy Nagar. He also inaugurated several new Sai Baba temples in several places in Andhra Pradesh  and also started Sai Baba Samajams at other places outside Chennai.
<br>
As  days  passed, devotees started flocking to Kesavaiahji for succour and he was the medium through whom Baba’s Grace passed to them. Nearly seven years after his miraculous experience, Kesavaiahji started sharing the illness of his devotees in curing them. Kesavaiahji had many mystic visions in which Baba blessed him. In one of these visions, Baba gave him holy water and in another, Baba blessed him by keeping his hands on Kesavaiahji’s head. Baba several times indicated in advance the coming dangers to him and helped him in tiding over the dangers.
<br>
He wrote several articles on Baba and about his philosophy to several magazines. Thus he was propagating about Baba and was also assisting several people in attaining spiritual enlightenment. He did service like that for such a long period of about 40 years.
<br>
Today, as a monument of Baba’s Grace, a magnificent Sai Baba Temple had taken shape at Shenoynagar in Chennai. Swami Kesavaiahji inaugurated The Sai Mandir at Vidya nagar on March 12, 1981.  After serving Baba relentlessly, he later attained mahasamadhi on 7th August, 1981.  Blessed was his soul.
