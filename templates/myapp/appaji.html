   (Appaji Patel was sturdy and strong and was thinking that he had the strength of mythological Bhima. He also displayed his strength on several occasions by lifting Baba. But Baba wanted to put his pride down and accordingly on one occasion, he could not lift Baba at which Baba laughed and his pride came down.)

   Bayyaji Appaji Patel also called as Bayyaji Patel or Bayji Kote knew Baba since his childhood. His house was one of the five houses from where Baba used to seek alms regularly. Baba used to collect alms in the beginning eight times a day, later four times a day and reduced subsequently to two times a day and finally reduced to one time a day till his Mahasamadhi. From his 11th year onwards, Appaji Patel was serving Baba with clip_image001unswerving devotion.
   <br>
   His house was one of the few houses from which Baba took his bikhsha, i.e., begged bread from the beginning of his life here and up to the end. At about 8-00 AM, Baba would start on his begging rounds and went to his house and other four houses. Appaji Patel was sturdy and strong and he was, in general, thinking that he had the strength of mythological Bhima. He also displayed his strength on several occasions by lifting Baba after massaging his legs and placing him in front of dhuni. But Baba wanted to put his pride down and accordingly on one occasion, he could not lift Baba at which Baba laughed and his pride came down.
   <br>
   Baba used to give, for full 14 years till his Mahasamadhi, four Rupees daily to Appaji Patel and advised him not to part with or spend it but only use it for the purpose of investment only and accordingly he saved all such amounts and invested them for purchase of as many as 84 acres of land. He had already 10 or 11 acres of other land. Thus with Baba’s Grace he became very rich. Baba gave advices to him on several matters. Once Baba advised Appaji Patel not to raise sugarcane crop in his fields, but despite Baba’s advice, he raised sugarcane crop and incurred some loss. Baba had wonderful knowledge about future developments.

   Ramnavami celebrations were started in Shirdi in 1896 and from that year onwards, Baba permitted Hindus to affix sandal paste to Baba and do pooja and allowed Muslims to read Koran before him in the masjid. Urs celebrations also were started by Appa Kulkarni out of his gratitude for Baba for the acquittal, granted to him with Baba’s Grace, in the embezzlement case against him. Baba also allowed Namaz in the masjid, but only on Saturdays. To avoid differences between Hindus and Muslims and bring among them a sense of brotherhood, Baba asked sandal paste to be applied to Hindus and Muslims as well. His father, Nana Sahib Chandorkar, Tatya Patel and few others bore the expenses of these celebrations.

   In 1913, his father who was over 70 years of age went out as usual on horse back and returned with a stroke of paralysis. He went to Baba and asked for his Udhi. Baba said, "I will not give Udhi. Allah Malik Hai." . On the third day of the attack, his father passed away on an auspicious day. Next day Appaji Patel went to the masjid and then Baba asked him not to worry about the loss of his father and also said that his father would take birth as his son shortly. As per Baba’s words, he got a son subsequently.

   On 15th Oct, 1918, which was Tuesday, Dashami ended and Ekadashi arrived and the time was 2.30 in the afternoon and also in the Muslim month of Muharram, Baba told him that he was going away, asked him to carry him (Baba) to Dagdiwada (stone building constructed by Booty) and expressed that all Brahmins would be living near him. Baba also said that he did not feel well in the masjid and also Baba added, "I am going. Carry me to Wada. All Brahmins will be living near me." With these words, he breathed his last. After these words were spoken, Nana Nimonkar poured water into Baba’s mouth but the water came out. Appaji Patel held his hand below Baba’s chin to catch the water. Baba leaned upon Appaji Patel and passed away into Mahasamadhi. After noon arati was over, Baba sent all the devotees including Kaka Dixit to go to wada and take meals and they were taking the meals but on hearing the news of Baba’s Mahasamadhi, all of them rushed to the masjid without completing the meals. At that time, there were many troubles. Government took charge of all the properties. There was wrangling between Hindus and Muslims. Muslims said that Baba should be buried in a separate building to be constructed at the expense of people who like Appaji Patel and few others, had got benefit by Baba’s daily bounty. All Hindus wanted firmly burial in the Dagdiwada in accordance with Baba's desire. The Kopergaon Mamlatdar, Kulkarni was present at that time and the Rahata Foujdar Chakra Narayana also was present. The Mamlatdar decided that the public present, including. both Hindus and Muslims should express their views and that he would agree with the views of the majority for carrying out the task. Muslims prepared Mahajar with their signatures and their strength was 100 or less. Hindus prepared Mahajar with their signatures and their strength was over 200 and among these Hindus, there were prominent persons like H. S. Dixit, Bapu Saheb Jog, Bala Saheb Bhate, and others. Therefore the views of the Hindus, being that of the majority, prevailed and Baba's body was interred in the Dagdiwada in accordance with Baba’s desire.

   On 16th Oct, Wednesday, arati and pooja was performed as usual to Baba’s Body as per Baba’s instructions given to Laxmanmama Joshi in his dream in the early morning on Wednesday. Laxmanmama Joshi or Laxmanrao Kulkarni Ratnaparkhi was maternal uncle of Madhavrao Deshpande/Shama. He was a  resident of Shirdi itself and was an orthodox Brahmin. As Laxmanrao was the maternal uncle of Madhavrao, he was known as ‘Laxman Mama’ in the village. He was the Vatandar Kulkarni and Gram Joshi of Shirdi Village. He did not have faith initially in Baba; but based on his personal experience and that of his only son, Bappaji, he became a staunch devotee of Baba and treated Baba as God-incarnate. At the time of Baba’s Mahasamadhi, Baba appeared in his dream, asking him to come and perform Kakad Arati and also based on his firm faith that Baba is ever living, he came, despite protests by others, and performed puja to Baba (Baba’s body).  Nearly after 36 hours after Baba’s Mahasamadhi, Baba’s Body was moved from the masjid and given a bath on a wooden cot and his kafni was easily removed without any tearing. On Wednesday night, Baba’s Body was taken in procession from the masjid and brought to Dagdiwada and interred with all formalities in the Dagdiwada. Baba thus miraculously occupied the temple premises instead of Muralidhar in the Dagdiwada, as perhaps he was the incarnation of Lord Krishna..

   In 1932, Baba gave him timely intimation about a bull. At Shirdi, a bull was marked with a trident, being thus dedicated to God Shiva and was freely grazing all over the village and near the Lendi garden also. It was creating harm to the gardens and hence he along with others contributed some money for the expenses of sending it to a pinjrapole at Yeola. The bull was then entrusted to one Bhiku Marwadi with the money for taking it away to be left at the pinjrapole. Bhiku returned after some time and told them that he had performed that duty. That night Baba appeared in Appaji Patel’s dream and said, "Are you sleeping ? I have been tied to the door of a butcher." Then he immediately woke up and consulted Tatya Patel and others on this dream. All of them concluded that the bull had been left with a butcher and not left at the pinjrapole at Yeola as asked by them. So Appaji Patel started at once and went to Yeola and searched for the bull at the two pinjrapole-places there. It was not there and he learnt that Bhikku had not taken the bull there. Then he went round and looked near the butchers' quarters. The bull was located and was lifting its head over a wall at that time and was found in a butcher's place. It was to be cut up that very day by the butcher and the butcher told him that he had purchased it for Rs.14 from Bhiku. The bull was thus rescued and placed in the pinjrapole. A case was filed against Bhiku who was charged, convicted and sentenced to 2 months' imprisonment. Even after Baba’s Mahasamadhi, Baba was active, guiding and protecting all the devotees in the same way in which he used to do when he was in mortal coil.

   He was interviewed by B.V.Narasimha Swamiji in 1936 when he was aged 47 years and he gave all these details minutely based on which all his experiences with Baba came to light. His portrait was also installed in the Samadhimandir along with the portraits of other ardent devotees.
