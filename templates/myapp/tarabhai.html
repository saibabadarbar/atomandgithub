 <br>
(Mrs.Tarabai observed Baba vis-a-vis many other saints & gave her views about Baba's superhuman powers and about Baba's powerful eyes & several other miracles she had experienced)
<br>
Mrs. Tarabai Sadasiv Tarkhad was the wife of Sadasiva Tarkhad, brother of Ramachandra Atmaram Tarkhad (R.A.Tarkhad). R.A.Tarkhad was the Secretary of the famous Khatau Mills, Bombay. R.A.Tarkhad once visited Shirdi and came back and told Mrs.Tarabai Sadasiva about the great powers of Sai Baba. At that time her daughter, by name Nalini Tarkhad who was 15 months old was seriously ill and she immediately took a vow that if Baba was really a great saint and if he could cure the child from her serious illness, she would pay a visit to Shirdi with the child for Baba’s darshan. Immediately, the child got cured miraculously and then she visited Shirdi with the child. The child grew happily and became later on, a famous film star, Ms, Nalini Jaywant.
It is interesting to know about the family background of Ramachandra Atmaram Tarkhad and Sadasiva Tarkhad. Ramachandra Atmaram was a follower of Prarthana Samaj and did not believe in idol-worship.  They belonged to a great historic and wealthy family. At the time of the capture of Vasai Fort in Thane district about 50 kms. from Bombay,  by Peshwas, they lost 21 members in their family and were therefore awarded as jagir the village of Tarkhad which is nearby. By the end of 19th century, Atmaram’s father and his uncle moved to Bombay and settled there permanently. In those days they were having two big Studebaker motor cars indicative of their status in the society and they used to move with the highest officials in the society as also with the British Governors. Atmaram was the Secretary of the famous Khatau Mills and his monthly salary was about four thousand rupees in those days. Having been brought up in this family background, the Tarkhads did not like the orthodox religious scruples and was against Idol-worship and visiting saints and sages. But due to the efforts of his wife, Tarabai, Sadasiva Tarkhad became a staunch devotee of Baba.
Once Tarabai visited Shirdi and at that time Shirdi was a small village without any basic facilities. There was no sweeping on the roads which were without lighting and all the streets were totally dark during the nights. One night when she was walking in a street, she suddenly stopped impulsively without any reason and she did not know why she stopped abruptly. A little later, some one brought a light and she saw suddenly a snake just in front of her and if she had put her next step forward, the consequences would have been serious, if not fatal. She was not sure who prompted her to stop and at whose instance the light was brought on the road and all these were inexplicable and she felt that it was all due to the ever watchfulness of Baba and his continuous protection.
<br>
Once when she was in Shirdi, her eyes were paining and water was flowing from her eyes and this was happening for some time. Then she went to the masjid and sat before Baba. Baba looked at her and then the pain in her eyes stopped and also water stopped flowing from her eyes.
<br>
Once she was sitting near Baba in the masjid, then a leper came to the masjid with his advanced disease. The leper was stinking and he had little strength left in him and with much difficulty he climbed very slowly the three steps of the masjid and came to Baba and placed his head on Baba's feet. He took much time for Baba’s darshan and all the while she was feeling the foul strench from him intensely and hoped that he would clear off quickly. Then he walked down slowly with a small parcel wrapped up in a dirty cloth. She felt immediate relief and thanked God.within herself as the leper went down Sai Baba at once looked at her and she immediately understood that Baba had already read her thought. As the leper was moving further, Baba immediately sent some one from the masjid to fetch the leper back. The same leper again had come and again the slow process of his climbing up the masjid steps continued while emitting the foul strench all the time and when the leper bowed to Baba, Baba picked up that parcel, enquiring about it and opened it. It contained some pedas(sweets). Baba took up a piece and gave it to her only, even though others were present in the masjid and asked her to eat it. She was in a dilemma before eating up a thing brought by the stinking leper. But it was Baba's order and there was no option but to obey and she ate it up. Baba took another piece and ate it and then sent the leper away with the remaining pedas. Why he was recalled and why she was only given the peda--no body could understand. But she knew fully well that Baba had read her thoughts and wanted to teach her a valuable lesson upholding the values on humility, sympathy, endurance with focus on the need of having utmost trust in Baba rather than on her own views of hygiene and sanitation. This also emphasized the supreme principle that in the presence of Baba no danger would touch anybody.
<br>
Once she went to Shirdi with her husband, Sadasiva and also took with them their servant. Their servant had acute pain in his lumbar region and was suffering from the pain since a long time. Sadasiva went to Baba in the masjid and at that time there were other people also in the masjid. Baba suddenly said that his leg was paining and that the pain was severe and asked some one to bring green leaves (korphad) available near the Lendibagh, spilt them into two and heat them slightly and then apply it on the area where the pain was severe and also said that the pain would disappear. Sadasiva thought that it was a direction for them only and as directed he followed and applied it to the waist area in the lumbar portion of their servant who got cured immediately.
<br>
In 1915 or so, she was having severe neuralgic headache and tried all types of treatments but they were of no use. She was disgusted with the continuing severe headache. She was totally dejected and decided to put an end to her life in Shirdi. She somehow convinced her husband and both arrived at Kopargaon and she wanted to have a bath in the holy Godavari river before her death. She also knew that a cold bath would aggravate the headache. As she decided to die shortly, she did not mind having aggravated pain. She took a bath in the cold water and miraculously the headache did not aggravate and on the other hand the headache suddenly disappeared totally. This was all due to the miracle of Baba. They both visited Shirdi and thanked Baba for having cured her severe neuralgic headache.
<br>
Her husband, Sadasiv was working as Manager in a textile mill in Poona for some time and then lost his job and was without a job for a long time. He came to Shirdi to seek Baba’s blessings in getting a job and stayed there for some days. One day Baba told Sadasiv that Tatya Patil and others were going to Ahmednagar to see cinema and asked Sadasiv to accompany them and see cinema in Ahmednagar and then go to Poona and home. Hearing this from the mouth of Baba, he was perplexed and thought within himself that why Baba was asking him to do like that as that was not the occasion for him to spend time in amusement. Anyhow as he had full faith in Baba and just followed Baba’s orders and then he left with Tatya and others to Ahmednagar, saw the cinema and then went to Poona and stayed with a friend. In Poona at that time, he came to know that a labour trouble broke out in the same mill where he was working earlier and that the management of the mill wanted him frantically back in the mill to manage the situation as he was a vary capable manager to handle such labour matters and for that purpose the mill-management sent messages to his home at Bombay and other places, asking him immediately to come back. Thus he got reemployed miraculously in the same mill in Poona with Baba’s Grace. Though Baba’s orders prima facie looked irrelevant and cryptic, they had lot of meaning and only meant ultimately for the welfare of the devotee.
<br>
When she was interviewed by B.V.Narasimhaswamiji in 1936, she was also called as ‘Mrs.Manager’. In the interview, she also said that Baba used to sit in the early mornings near the Dhuni and wave hands and fingers, making some gestures which, of course, conveyed no meanings to outsiders, but conveyed in reality some directions to Panchbhutas (five elements) for the welfare of the public in general and of the devotees in particular. And at the end, Baba used to say, “Haq” which means God Almighty. Whenever Baba wanted to bestow ecstasy on his devotees, he would dart out drishtipath (shots of divine Grace-look) to them making them ecstatic for a longer time.
<br>
Even after Baba’s Mahasamadhi, Baba was helping the devotees. Once in 1927, she was on a pilgrimage with her husband, Sadasiv and visited Shirdi when she was in the family way. But the child died in the womb and no delivery followed for some days. Then the colour of her body started becoming blue with suspected blood poisoning. She became unconscious and did not know what happened subsequently.  Then Sadasiv took her with him to Sakori and prayed to Upasani Baba for help. At that time, Upasani Baba's fame had reached its pinnacle and was functioning as a Sadguru at Sakori.  But, Upasani Baba said that the best doctor and the best nurse were available in Shirdi and asked them to go to Shirdi, visit Baba’s Samadhi and seek Baba’s help. Then they went to Shirdi. She was still unconscious in Shirdi. In her unconscious stage, she started uttering certain steps and directions to be taken to protect her and they literally followed the directions. They also applied Baba’s udi and gave thirth. Due to these efforts, the dead child got expelled from her womb and she started recovering gradually and after a month she became normal. This was an instance of Baba’s wonderful miracles even after Baba’s Mahasamadhi.
<br>
She said that Baba was a unique saint totally different from other saints in that Baba was omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent. She saw many saints and moved with many saints. As per her observations, all these saints used to go to a trance position to know certain things. But it was not so in the case of Baba who was knowing instantaneously the events that were happening any where without the need to go into any trance-position. She also said that Baba had wonderful and powerful eyes and when he looked at any body, his eyes would penetrate deep through his glance and would read the other person’s mind and no body could look at Baba’s eyes continuously except for a short while and then invariably would have to lower his looks down.
<br>
Whenever she was in Shirdi, she used to stay with Radhakrishna Mai & Tarabai observed Radhakrishna Mai very closely. Tarabai paid tributes to Radhakrishna Mai and said that she was fully devoted to Baba’s service, cleaning the roads where Baba used to walk, arranged several seva services to Baba. She also said that Radhakrishna Mai was held in high esteem by all the people in Shirdi and that she was an adept in thought-reading and proficient in clairvoyance, but of course, had a sharp tongue. Because of Tarabai’s keen observation of events in Shirdi, she threw lot of light on Baba’s wonderful powers, some of Baba’s daily routine, his cryptic way of solving devotees’ problems and his method of teaching and about Baba’s powers even after Baba’s Mahasamadhi. Blessed was her soul as she threw lot of light on Baba’s life and his mission.
