(She used to walk daily on every noon many miles in the jungle, trampling bushes and shrubs in search of him and used to offer food to Baba. She was the first person to take care of feeding Baba. She wanted children to Tatya even though he had three wives. Baba liked Tatya and went into Mahasamadhi by taking on him the death of Tatya in exchange and thus saved Tatya.)
<br>
Sai Baba in the early days of his stay at Shirdi spent his time either wandering in the outskirts of Shirdi village and neighboring thorny
jungles or sitting under the neem tree in meditation with detachment. The first set of villagers who treated Baba as a saintly person
were Mhalsapati, Tatya Kote, Bayyaji Bai and few others. Bayyaji Bai felt deeply motivated by Baba as a Divine Saint and with her motherly
 affection she used to walk daily on every noon, many miles in the jungle, trampling bushes and shrubs in search of him, carrying food in a basket on her head. Often she found Baba sitting under some tree in deep meditation, calm and motionless. She would boldly approach him, place a leaf before him and spread on the leaf, bread, vegetables etc and force him to eat and then only she used to return to her home for her food. Such was the attention she was paying towards Baba and she was the first person to take care of Baba in feeding him.
<br>
Bayyaji Bai did selfless service to Baba extraordinarily without expectation of any favours. Tatya became very rich and all his troubles were averted by Baba’s Grace. Baba said that Bayyaji Bai was his sister in the previous janmas (births).
<br>
After sometime as though out of compassion for her, Baba stopped wandering here and there in the forest and moved into a dilapidated mosque in the outskirts of the village and named the mosque where he resided till the end as Dwarakamai, the abode of Lord Krishna. About 8-00 A.M., Baba would start on his begging rounds for alms. Initially Baba used to seek alms as many as 15 times daily from Bayyaji Bai's house. He went to the houses of Ganapati Tatya Patil (Bayajabai), Appaji Patil, Sakharam Shelke, Waman Gondkar and Nanduram Marwadi. With affection and reverence, all these householders were offering food as and when Baba approached them even once or more than once in every day. As they offered food without expecting any return from Baba, they were very happy in their lives and had their desires fulfilled with the Grace of Baba. Baba had a different way of calling for alms at each of the five houses at which he begged.He would say, "Abaad-e-abaad, Allah bhala karega," and bless the housewives. He would say, "Bayaja maa! Jevan de! Roti lao (give food, get the roti)!" at the house of Bayajabai. Ahmednagar district was in the grip of a famine in 1876, few years after Baba came to Shirdi. And during that time, Baba used to go to the houses of Nanduram and Bayaja Bai who were relatively well off. He was getting half a roti at both these houses during the famine time.
<br>

Bayyaji Bai’s house was situated adjacent to the masjid. She came to Shirdi after she married a rich landlord, Ganapathrao Kote Patil. Bayyaji Bai and her husband, Ganpathrao were the first people who observed the divine nature of Baba and his radiating stature. Both of them treated Baba as their own son. Baba also looked at Bayyaji Bai as his mother. At that time, the powerful villagers were opposed to Baba, treating him as a mad fakir.  She was a dutiful and loving wife, who did all the household chores. Besides these domestic duties, she loved to cook and feed various guests and relatives that used to come to her house. She considered food as Brahma and was the first lady to offer food to Baba when he came to Shirdi in the early days. In Hemadpant’s Sri Sai Satcharitra, there is a very good description about her love, devotion and attention paid to Baba. She was the first person in Shirdi to recognize the divinity of Baba.
<br>
Daily Baba took Biksha from her house.  As soon as she heard Baba’s voice she left whatever she was doing; whether it was attending to the cattle or horses or any other work, she would stop that work forthwith and went inside and prepared fresh Bhakari (bread made from jowar) and vegetable curry for him. Baba was very much pleased with her love, devotion and attention. Baba did not ask for dakshina from the beginning and it was Bayyajibai and her husband who provided money for the needs of Baba.   <br>

Bayyaji Bai requested Baba several times to have meals in their house. Very rarely Baba entered their house for meals. In one such occasion, Rambha Bai, one of Tatya's wife served the food to Baba and stood in a corner in the house and listened to the conversation between Baba and Bayyaji Bai. Rambha Bai expressed that their conversation was full of affection as if between a son and a mother. She also said that Baba did not touch non vegetarian food at any time. While in the conversation, Bayyaji Bai enquired about Baba's earlier years and asked about Baba's family members or their whereabouts. But no clue or even a hint came from Baba. She also enquired about Baba's region, caste, parents and acquaintances, but Baba did not give even a passing hint about these matters.
<br>
Baba asked her once what she wanted. Baba said, "Do you want Sampathi (wealth) or Santhathi (welfare of your family)"?. Unhesitatingly she asked for the welfare of Tatya, who had no children at that time, though he had three wives. With Baba's blessings he had three sons and two daughters. Remembering fully the service thus rendered by her, Baba averted the death of Tatya Patil and offered his body instead. Baba knew the oncoming death of Tatya Patil and told Ramachandra Patil about this and asked him to keep it as a secret. But Ramachandra told Bala Shimpi about this and advised him to keep it as a secret. As the Vijayadasami day was fast approaching in 1918, Tatya became very unwell and weak and was bed ridden for which Ramachandra and Bala Shimpi were very anxious. On 15th Oct, 1918, in the house Tatya recovered and his pulse came to normal. Some new strength entered his body. He stood up and could even walk also. He cried out of joy. He could not understand from where he got this new energy all of a sudden. The onlookers were also surprised. He remembered Baba for this surprise. Thinking that Baba had given him another lease of life, he went running to the mosque and saluted Baba.  Baba saw that Tatya recovered fully well. Baba then asked Shama to take Tatya and leave him in his house. Shama returned after leaving Tatya in his house. The time was two o’ clock in the afternoon. While Tatya miraculously became well, Baba was unwell and passed away into Mahasamadhi, by taking on him the death of Tatya and saved Tatya. On 15th Oct, 1918, while Tatya miraculously became well, Baba became sick and was unwell and passed away into Mahasamadhi, by taking on him the death of Tatya in exchange and saved Tatya. That was the degree of affection Baba exhibited towards the family of Bayyaji Bai. Bayyaji Bai passed away at the age of 75 years during December 1911 and attained beatitude. Immediately thereafter, on 3rd January, 1912, Ganpathrao passed away. After the demise of Ganpathrao, it was Tatya who provided funds for Baba's needs thinking that he was Baba's son.
<br>
All the descendants of Bayyaji Bai were rich and their family became affluent. Even today, no body in their family touches any food without offering as naivedya to Baba. The Shirdi Saibaba Sansthan had bestowed on their descendants the honor of carrying Baba’s Photograph and Padukas during the Palkhi procession. It was a great honour for them.
