    Shankar Narayan Vaidya   alias   Nanavalli   was  a   peculiar   person.  It   was  not   clear whether Nanavalli was treating Baba as a divine saint. He was  treating Baba with  love and lot of respect. His early childhood and background were shrouded  in  mystery. He was notorious for his erratic and eccentric behavior. Baba warned  him several   times not to create problems in Shirdi village. Many people were afraid of him. Some times, he would   carry snakes in his pockets and scorpions in his mouth.   He  would  also  violently abuse and attack some people for no valid reason. He called  himself  as General of  Sai Baba Army. Some others felt that he was a  great  person   with   lot of  foresight. His appearance was wild and disheveled. Sometimes he would appear nude and on some other occasions he was  dressed  in  old  sacking.   If   we   study   the   life  of   Nanavalli,  we will   understand   about   his   strong   but   concealed   devotion   towards  Baba   and also as an outstanding model of vairagya (dispassion).

    Nanavalli was a unique and intriguing devotee of Sai Baba, who called himself the ‘General of Sai Baba’s army.’ His background and history are shrouded in as much mystery as Sai Baba’s and he was notorious for his erratic and eccentric behavior.
    <br>
    Some people were afraid of this man-not only would he carry snakes in his pockets, and scorpions in his mouth, but he would violently abuse and attack certain people for no apparent reason. Others felt him to be a Mahatma, with an outstanding love for Sai Baba. His appearance was wild and disheveled- sometimes he went nude and at others he dressed in old sacking.
    <br>    Similar to Sai Baba, little was known about Nanavalli's background, birth and other details. One account says that he  was  a  Brahmin   by birth  and some others say that he was born into a Muslim family. Sometimes he wore the clothes of a Muslim fakir and at other times he  was found in the dress of a Hindu ascetic. Then again like Baba, his religious roots were not known. However, both versions agree that as a small  boy  Nanavalli   served  in  a  Muslim darga and came to attend Baba upon divine inspiration. Nobody knows when he came to  Shirdi, but  some   say that he was already there when Baba arrived in Shirdi with the wedding party. At that time, on   seeing Baba, it appeared that Nanavalli greeted Baba  affectionately, saying,   "Oh,  Uncle,  you   have   come!" Thereafter, he always addressed Baba as “Mama" or “Uncle.”  Nanavalli was content to see Baba occasionally and from a distance, but his  devotion  to   Baba was such that Baba should get lot of fame and glory. He used to say, "My duty is only to protect my  uncle". Nanavalli could not bear immorality or hypocrisy. He seemed to read the inner thoughts of devotees and target them accordingly. He was known to  occasionally   wait   outside   the masjid and abuse and beat certain individuals for no apparent reason. Though people would rush to Baba and complain, Baba, though he would warn Nanavalli, would ask the devotees to be careful about him.

    If we investigate the life of Nanavalli, we uncover a tale of touching and inspiring devotion, and an outstanding model of vairagya (dispassion). As with Sai Baba, little is known about Nanavalli’s background. One account says that he was a Brahmin by birth and another that he was born into Muslim family. Sometimes he wore the clothes of a Muslim fakir, and at other those of a Hindu sadhu. Then again like Baba, his religious roots were ambiguous. However, both versions agree that as a small boy Nanavalli served in a Muslim darga and came to attend to Baba upon divine inspiration. Nobody knows when he came to Shirdi, but some say he was already there when Baba arrived with the wedding party. Upon seeing Baba, Nanavalli greeted him affectionately, “Oh, Uncle, you have come!” Thereafter, he always addressed Baba as “Mama” or “Uncle.”

    Nanavalli’s love for Baba <br>

    Nanavalli was content to see Baba occasionally and from a distance, but his emotion for Baba was such that he felt all glory and greatness should be Baba’s and that none should accrue to himself. He used to say, “My duty is only to protect my uncle”. Nanavalli could not bear immorality or hypocrisy. He seemed to know devotees’ inner thoughts and target them accordingly. He was known to occasionally wait outside Dwarakamai and beat up certain individuals. Though people would rush to Baba and complain, Baba would never reprimand Nanavalli, but simply warn them to be careful of him. H.V.Sathe was a prominent devotee with a prestigious job in the colonial government. For some reason, he was particularly harassed by Nanavalli. During the Chavadi processions, Sathe had the privilege of carrying a sort of regal scepter and walking in front of Baba. 0n one such occasion Nanavalli attacked Sathe on the back with a piece of broken glass. Another time, when Sathe was about to go to the mosque to worship Baba, his father–in-law rushed in and begged him not to, as Nanavalli was waiting there with an axe threatening to kill him. Sathe was so afraid that he fled Shirdi without seeing Baba or getting his permission to leave. That was in 1916 and he never came back to Shirdi again while Baba was alive.
    <br><br>
    As Sai Baba’s fame grew, he was worshipped with increasing pomp and splendor. 0ne day Nanavalli strolled into the mosque, which was crowded with visitors, and to the horror of those present, demanded from Baba, “Please get up. I want to sit there” Baba immediately rose from his gaddi saying, “Please sit”. Nanavalli took his place. The devotees were appalled at his audacity and wanted to drag him away, but when they saw Baba’s expression- calm and happy they desisted. After a few moments Nanavalli exclaimed “Shabhash” (“good, well done”) prostrated to Baba and danced ecstatically before leaving. Some say that Nanavalli wished to test the object of his adoration to see if any egoism had crept in, but others believe that he harbored no such doubts and simply wanted to demonstrate Baba’s purity and detachment. Baba did not comment on the incident and none dared to ask him about it. Nanavalli’s attachment to Baba was so great that he used to say, “If Baba goes, I’ll not be around for long”. Sure enough, when Baba passed away, Nanavalli rushed to Dwarakamai crying. “Uncle, without you how can I live “? I am coming with you” with that he went to the Hanuman Mandir. There he wept grievously and took no food. 0n the thirteenth day Nanavalli passed away.

    Life lessons to be learned from Nanavalli
    <br><br>
    Have an intense and unshakeable love for your Guru; nothing else matters
    <br><br>He looked to Baba’s work and affairs. He once approached Baba who was seated on His Gadi (seat) and asked Him to get up, as he wanted to occupy the same. Baba, at once got up and left the seat, which he had occupied. After sitting there a while Nanavali got up, and asked Baba to resume His seat. Then, Baba sat down seat and Nanavali fell at His feet. Baba did not show the slightest displeasure in being dictated to or ousted.

This Nanavali loved Baba so much that, he breathed his last, on the thirteenth day of Baba’s taking Maha-Samadhi.”
    <br><br>
    Nanavali is perhaps one of the most Misunderstood devotees of Sai Baba. Dr Vinny Chitluri pays tribute to Narayan Shankar Vaidya who Baba affectionately called Nanavali. He had some peculiar characteristics; many of Baba’s devotees and the villagers found him eccentric, while some thought him to be an Avadhoota.
    <br><br>
    His love and faith for Sai Baba was so intense that 13 days after Baba’s Mahasamadhi, Nanavali took Jeevant Samadhi. He said “My Mama (Baba) has gone, what is the use of living?” and on the 13th day he just lay down and said, “It’s no use living in this world anymore,” and took Samadhi. Nanavali is one of Baba’s greatest devotees.
<br>

H.V.Sathe was a prominent devotee holding the post of a Deputy Collector. Sathe constructed the first wada, called Sathewada as per the orders of Baba for the benefit of the visiting pilgrims to Shirdi for having darshan of Baba. Earlier there was no such shelter in Shirdi for the pilgrims to stay. For some reason, Sathe was particularly harassed by Nanavalli. During the Chavadi processions, Sathe had the privilege of carrying a sort of Regal Scepter (Royal Staff) and used to walk in front of Baba. 0n one such occasion, Nanavalli attacked Sathe on the back with a piece of broken glass. Another time, when Sathe was about to go to the masjid to worship Baba, Dada Kelkar, his father-in-law observed and rushed to the masjid and begged him not to do any harm to Sathe, as Nanavalli was waiting near the masjid with an axe threatening to kill him. Sathe was so afraid that he had to leave Shirdi with Baba’s permission and settle in Poona once and for all. This incident happened in 1916.
<br>
Shyamrao Jayker, the famous painter who painted Baba’s original portraits and Dr. Chidambaram Pillai, both staunch devotees of Baba, were initially moving with Nanavalli who also once beat Dr.Pillai. Then Baba warned Nanavalli and cautioned both of them not to move with Nanavalli. Like that, some other devotees also had similar experience with Nanavalli.
<br>
As Baba's fame grew, a large number of pilgrims started visiting Shirdi and Baba was worshipped with increasing pomp and splendor with royal dignity. 0ne day Nanavalli suddenly came into the masjid, which was crowded with a large number of visitors and to the surprise and horror of one and all present, he asked Baba, saying, "Please get up. I want to sit there" Baba immediately got up from his gaddi/seat and then Nanavalli sat in his place. The devotees were shocked at his audacity and thought of dragging him from that place. But seeing the calm posture of Baba, they stopped that idea. Thereafter Nanavalli addressed Baba as Nawab and asked Baba how he was. Baba replied saying that he was not a Nawab, but only the same fakir. Then Nanavalli asked Baba how the world was looking to him. To this, Baba replied saying that the world was looking the same as it was earlier and that there was no change.  Then Nanavalli exclaimed, "Shabhash".  (Good, well done) and then prostrated before Baba and expressed happiness and danced ecstatically before leaving the masjid. This had happened in 1915 on a Thursday. It is really difficult to understand the behaviour of Nanavalli. About this incident, some expressed that Nanavalli wanted to test Baba whether any egoism had crept in, following lot of fame of Baba due to influx of large number of devotees, but others also felt that he had no such doubts but simply wanted to demonstrate to the public at large about Baba's simplicity, purity and detachment. But Baba did not comment on the incident and none dared to ask Baba about it.
<br>
Nanavalli's attachment to Baba was so great that he used to say, "If Baba goes, I’ll not be around for long" Accordingly, when Baba passed away into Mahasamadhi, Nanavalli rushed to the masjid and cried, saying, "Uncle, without you, how can I live? I am coming with you”. He then went to the Hanuman Mandir where he wept grievously and took no food for several days. 0n the thirteenth day after Baba’s Mahasamadhi, Nanavalli passed away on 27th Oct, 1918 at the age of 70 years and his Samadhi is there in the Lendibagh. His ways were always inscrutable.
