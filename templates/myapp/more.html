      <p> S. B. Dhumal may be cited as one of the most ardent bhaktas of Sai Baba, who surrendered himself entirely to Baba with the fullest confidence. He acted in very important matters, official and professional, with full trust in Baba for the success of his efforts. He was a mofussil Pleader, practicing at Nasik and was in fairly prosperous circumstances when he first heard about Sai Baba in 1907,

    <p> Hari Sitaram Dixit alias Kakasaheb Dixit was a well known solicitor of Mumbai active in public life who was persuaded to visit Sai Baba in 1909 by his friend Nana Chandorkar. The reasons for giving him prominent mention so early in Baba's history is that he was very largely responsible for the establishment and progress of Shirdi Sai Baba Sansthan, the affairs of which were managed by him as Honorary Secretary very ably and enthusiastically up to the time of his death, i.e., on 5th July 1926. He was also responsible for drawing large numbers to Shirdi and filling them with admiration and enthusiasm for Sai Baba. He also took care of "Sai Leela Masik" the Marathi Monthly Magazine of Shri Sai Baba Sansthan till July 1926.

    <p>Let us first see where and how Baba slept, Mr. Nanasaheb Dengale brought, for Sai Baba, a wooden plank, amount 4 cubits in length and only a span in breath, for sleeping upon. Instead of keeping the plank on the floor and then sleeping on it, Baba tied it like a swing to the rafters of the Masjid with old shreds or rags and commenced to sleep upon it. The rags were so thin and worn out that it was a problem how they could bear or support even weight of the plank itself, let alone the weight of Baba. But somehow or other-it was Baba's sheer Leela that the worn out rags did sustain the plank, with the weight of Baba on it. On the four corners of this plank, Baba lighted panatis (earthen lamps), one at each corner, and kept them burning the whole night. It was a sight for the Gods to see Baba sitting or sleeping on this plank! It was a wonder to all, how Baba got up and down the plank. Out of curiosity, many careful observers kept watching the process of mounting and dismounting, but none succeeded. As crowds began to swell so to detect this wonderful feat, Baba one day broke the plank into pieces and threw it away.
    Baba had all the eight Siddhis (powers) at His command. He never practiced nor craved for them. They came to Him naturally, as a result of His perfection. <br>

  <p> I had a daughter by my first wife. I then became a widower before my fortyfourth year. Many friends and acquaintances were pressing me to get married, e.g. Mr. Barve, Mamlatdar of Kopargaon. I was declining to take the extraordinary step of marrying at about fifty, though I was no doubt anxious to have a son to continue my line.

Mahadev’s wife was surprised to see the same divine aura around Baba as that of Vittal in Pandharpur. Mahadev and his wife, both witnessed the resplendent Chavadi Procession where Baba looked like a veritable Vithal of Pandharpur. Baba had made these details available to us through the sincere efforts of a devotee, Lt. Col. Nimbalkar, an ankita devotee of Baba).

  <p>Damodar Ghanshyam Babare came from the village Chinchani in Thana district. Hence, every body started calling him as Anna Chinchanikar. He and his wife, Laxmi Bai came and were living in Shirdi in the service of Baba and were devoted to Baba. For many years they did selfless service not expecting or asking any favours from Baba. Anna Chinchanikar was a simple and rough but straightforward person. He cared for nobody, always spoke plainly and carried all dealings in cash. Though he looked outwardly harsh and uncompromising, he was a good natured, frank and fair person. So Baba loved him.
