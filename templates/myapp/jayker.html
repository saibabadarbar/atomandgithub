           SHYAMRAO  JAYKER  &  B. V. TALIM  &  D.D. NEROY & Dr.S.M.Pandit<br><hr>
 <p style="color:white;">(The three persons who were mainly instrumental in making available the pictures and photos of Shirdi Sai Baba to the posterity and all of us, are Shamrao Jayker, Balaji Vasant Talim and D.D.Neroy who made respectively, the original oil paintings of Baba and the most beautiful marble Idol of Baba installed in the Samadhi Mandir in Shirdi and photo-prints. Baba was averse to photos/paintings. Even though, all of them had much difficulty in making portraits of Baba, Baba’s Marble Idol and photos of Baba, they ultimately succeeded with Baba’s Grace, in making the oil paintings of Baba and in the sculpting of Baba’s life-like Idol and Baba's photographs respectively. Based on these original pictures and photos only, several photos were/are being taken subsequently in innumerable shades as derivatives. Therefore we are all indebted to these three ardent devotees for making available to all of us, the pictures of Shirdi Sai Baba).
(How merciful was Baba. Even animals and creatures also knew that Baba would protect them as he was God).
<br>Shyam Rao Jayker was a famous painter and was a resident in Ville Parle, Bombay. He first visited Shirdi in 1913 and also during 1916-1917. During his stay in 1916-17, he went and stayed with others. But, when others left Shirdi, he continued to stay. When he was with others he was getting money and so he was giving dakshina to Baba whenever Baba asked him. Baba never asked him dakshina when he did not have money. Baba knew about his condition and every thing without being told.
<br>
When he was a boy of 16 years, a Brahmachari gave him Siva Mantra Initiation. Later, a sanyasi gave him Sakti Mantra. When he went to Baba, he had thus his initiation into mantras. Baba’s advice to him and every other person was that they could follow their own guru, their religion and follow their religious tradition, but have faith in God for their welfare.
<br>
He knew some of the people in Shirdi. He never went to Radhkrishnamai as there was no need for him to go. He knew Nana Wali as a dangerous person and Baba warned him not to move with him. First, he had moved with Nana Wali and Dr. Pillai also moved with Nana Wali. But once Nana Wali beat Dr. Pillai and then both started keeping away from Nana Wali. Nana Wali was not worshipping Baba, but treated Baba with some respect. Baba would beat occasionally Nana Wali and warn him not to do mischief in Shirdi. All these happenings were known to Jayker.
<br>
During the eight months of his stay at Shirdi, he heard a lot of goshtis, talks of Baba. But, he said that he did not remember any of them. Baba, so far as he knew, did not give any Upadesh to any one. People went to Baba praying for health, wealth and solutions to other problems.
<br>
Baba did not permit anyone to take his photographs. If anyone dared to do so without his permission the frame would be either blank or without Baba. Baba on a rare occasion permitted Jaykar, an eminent Painter to paint a life like oil painting of Baba. He normally used to paint portraits of royal family members and British Lords and in 1913. Rao Bahadur Moreshwar W. Pradhan, another ardent devotee of Baba, requested him to visit Shirdi for making Baba's portrait. Jayker went to Baba during his first visit along with Pradhan who wanted him to give Pradhan a lifelike oil painting of Baba. So Jayker had to go and actually see Baba for painting purpose. He went and had a good look at Baba. Baba also looked at Jayker. Baba was not so famous at that time. Even Jayker was not aware about the powers and fame of Baba. During his journey to Shirdi, he was thinking that his visit to Shirdi would be futile. He had also thought that if he had gone to some royal palace, that would have fetched him a handsome amount. After reaching Shirdi they went to the masjid to have darshan of Baba. The first sentence Baba uttered, on seeing Jayker, was why he came to Shirdi and he should have gone to some royal palace and painted their portraits. What was the use of making out a portrait of a humble fakir like him. Then Baba's permission had to be obtained before an oil painting could be made of him. So Shama went to Baba and asked for his permission. Then Baba replied, "Why should I, a poor fakir, have an oil painting of me? You, Shama, you may get a portrait of yourself”. Ultimately, Shama convinced Baba and told Jayker that Baba's permission for the painting had been obtained. However, on Shama’s intercession only, Baba finally decided to sit in front of Jayker and allowed him to paint. Jayker, instead of painting one picture, as permitted, had painted four portraits. Then, Pradhan took two portraits and the third one was taken to Baba who touched it and then asked him to hand over to Dixit. The fourth one painted by Jayker is a big-sized portrait of Baba. That was left unused for some years and was later kept in the masjid for the innumerable devotee-visitors to have darshan of Baba through this portrait for their welfare.
<br>
This unique portrait of Sai Baba was in his Pooja Room since 1913. It is important to note that only Jayker got rare honour of painting three portraits of Sai Baba by making him sit in front of him. All other paintings were made after Baba's Mahasamadhi, based on either his paintings or any other painting based on Baba's photographs. Pradhan brought the two portraits to his house. Later they were lying with his family members in the folded canvas form for a very long time. Amazingly, around 1970, Pradhan's son and grandson, both, got the similar dream in the same night. Baba appeared in their dream and instructed them to deliver the portraits to his house. And thus he got one more blessed portrait of Baba. The other one was displayed on the home page of their website.
<br>
Baba was looking after him regularly with care and he was happy. Though, he lost two sons, Baba kept him and his family members always with contentment. He always felt that it was not for money that one should approach Baba, though he would give money also, whenever he thought proper. Baba used to say that the walls of his masjid were really made up of gold and wanted people to come and take away cartloads of that wealth; but his regret was that none came to take it away.
<br>
Baba had been very kind to Jayker. But, Jayker had been guilty of neglecting Baba’s words and forgetting several things. He had been so peculiarly indifferent in his temperament, he could not carry out things with conviction. Baba knew this very well. Once, Jayker was wishing to worship silver padukas of Baba, after receiving them from Baba’s own hands. So, Jayker got a small silver pair of padukas prepared and took them to Baba. He looked at them and Jayker. He received them. But, instead of giving them back to Jayker, Baba sloped his palms (on which the padukas were placed) downwards and the padukas fell down. Jayker picked them up and hoped to worship them. But, that very evening, Jayker gave out his clothes for wash, with the silver padukas lying inside a shirt-pocket. Thus he lost them and never got them back. Baba knew already these happenings and so did not give the padukas into Jayker’s hands but allowed them to slip off his hands, indicating in advance the future event.
<br>
On one occasion, Jayker had lent Rs.4,000 to a very rich Muslim purda lady without children. He had the need to recover the amount as he had a large family of 8 sons to support. But, the lady never repaid the money. So he went to Baba, prayed for his sympathy in recovering the money. But, Baba told him, “Let us have nothing to do with such evil or ill-fated wealth”. Jayker did not get back his money. Some time later, he came to know  that the same Muslim lady had lost all her wealth.
<br>
Ever since Jayker went to Baba, he was keeping Baba’s picture always with him; wherever he went, Baba was behind him protecting his family in several instances; but some of them only are narrated below:
<br>
In 1916, Jayker and his family were living in a suburban area in Bombay. Baba's picture was kept in a room in the house. One night at about 2-00 A.M. thieves were trying to enter into that house and succeeded in pulling out some rods of the window of the room where Baba’s picture was kept. And then it was very easy for them to enter the house and commit the theft. But a barber was sleeping in the verandah in a nearby house. It was customary for him to get up at 4-00 AM. every day and to go out for answering calls of nature. But at this time very strangely, he got up at 2-00 AM and went round the house due to call of nature. The thieves seeing him started running and he also shouted,”Thieves, Thieves”, and every one got up. All the people thought that Baba took care of his house and protected them against robbery.
<br>
In 1917, Jayker and his family were living at Poona in a dilapidated house, the ceiling and walls of which were weak and crumbling. To prevent the falling of dust from the ceiling, a long cloth had been stuck up under the ceiling. In that room, there was a picture of Baba and a kerosene lamp was burning before Baba’s photo and Jayker’s one year old child was also sleeping nearby.. At dead of night, they heard a loud sound by the fall of the ceiling cloth with debris and fall of some bricks from the weak walls on the fallen cloth. As the ceiling cloth covered the entire ceiling, it would have fallen with the bricks on the lamp and on the child sleeping nearby. But Baba protected the child as the debris, cloth and the bricks fell away from the child and the cloth did not catch fire. Thus Baba protected by saving the child.
<br>
During 1917, Jayker with his family went and stayed for 10 months at Shirdi by staying in the house of Sharadabai. A snake was living in a hole in the house in the small portion in which they were living and they saw the snake and were in danger. But nothing had happened to them as Baba protected them with his ever vigilant eyes.
<br>
Baba also helped him in the matters of spiritual pursuit by direct oral advice. Baba once told him "As you sow so you will reap". On another occasion, looking at Jayker he told  "We must serve the Guru". Baba did not elaborate this further. Baba already knew that Jayker had already received upadesh from a Guru, and that he had uttered the mantra for the prescribed period of more than 12 years..
<br>
Once during 1917. Jayker was sitting in the hall few yards away from the main masjid where Baba sat. One Varde was talking with Baba and told him that he wished to perform "Satyanarayana Pooja" there and wanted Baba’s permission. Baba gave permission. Then Varde said he had no funds to perform it. Then Baba pointing  out his finger towards Jayker asked Varde to go and approach Jayker and ask him to give money. Jayker knew Varde then only as a devotee of Baba and and did not know any thing other than that. But, Varde approached and told him that as per Baba’;s orders, he was seeking money for Satyanarayana Pooja. Jayker agreed and enquired him how much he required. He asked only Rs.2-5-0 which amount only Jayker was having in his pocket at that time and it was the entire amount he was having. This thought of asking for the entire amount from Jayker was at the inspiration of Baba who knew every thing. Jayker gave him Rs.2-5-0 at once. Then, Varde started procuring the required materials and made all the arrangements. He brought small plantain plants and set them on both sides of Baba, to make a pandal and tried to use Baba himself in the place of God Lakshmi Narayana for worship by way of pooja. But, Baba objected and asked him to have his usual images and perform the pooja. But, Varde and other devotees went on insisting that Baba should allow himself as the Main Deity in the place of Satya Narayana and allow them to perform the pooja for which Baba finally yielded.
<br>
Then, Satya Narayana Pothi was being read in the mantap below, while Jayker sat with other persons by the side of Baba in the masjid. But there was some disturbance in the mind of Jayker. He was interested in hearing Satya Narayan Pothi and also to continue to be seated near Baba. Again Jayker was hearing Pothi sitting up above the level where the Pothi reader was sitting. Thus he was sitting on a higher pedestal than that of the Pothi reader. Therefore he was perplexed and was unable to decide what to do. Baba evidently read the dilemma in the mind of Jayker and immediately asked him to go down, sit there and hear the pothi. Every idea in every mind was known to Baba..
<br>
Baba once showed lot of concern for the poor dumb creatures by protecting them from unnecessary harassment. Jayker was on the veranda of Dixitwada at Shirdi, one day, and saw a strange sight. Big dogs were running away when chased by a small white dog. It was clear that the small white dog was rabid and that the big dogs were afraid of its bite. The people available there, armed with sticks in their hands, went after the small white dog and wanted to kill it. When this was going on, Jayker had moved to the masjid and sat near Baba. The chasing people came running upto the masjid as the small white dog ran up the steps of the masjid and stood behind Baba, seeking protection. Perhaps that the white dog felt that Baba was its sanctuary and then the chasing people were afraid of entering into the masjid. The people waited for the dog to come out of the masjid. Seeing all these happenings, Baba abused them vigorously as they did not have any sympathy for a poor dumb creature. They expressed that the dog was mad and that it should be killed. He abused them and asked them to get away. Jayker and Dr. Pillai were in the masjid, sitting very near Baba and the dog, and Jayker and Dr.Pillai also knew that the dog was mad and felt internally that both of them were in danger. But finally the men went away and the dog was saved. Jayker then told Dr.Pillai that Baba was so generous that he cured the dog and saved its life. How merciful was Baba, even animals and creatures also knew that Baba would protect them as he was God. This miraculous incident had happened during May, 1917.
<br>
Even after Baba’s Mahasamadhi, during 1923, Jayker’s son Surendra, then aged ten, was suffering from typhoid. As gas was rising upward from his belly and pressing hard evidently against the diaphragm and heart, he cried out loudly saying, “Save me, Save me”. He had become extremely weak due to severe type of typhoid and Jayker was very much afraid of the boy’s condition. Jayker then cried loudly and uttered in a very loud voice, 'Baba.' Immediately, the upward pressure in the stomach got reduced and the boy after some time became almost normal and thus Baba saved the boy.
<br><br>
BALAJI  VASANT  TALIM <br>
Balaji Vasant Talim originally belonged to Hyderabad as his father was working with the Nizam of Hyderabad as building contractor and won several laurels and after the death of his father, the entire family moved to Bombay. After the school education, Talim joined Sir J.J.School of Art in Bombay to learn sculpture and was awarded the prestigious “Dolly Khurshetjee” scholarship and with this scholarship he completed his education in Sculptures.
<br>
In the Samadhi Mandir in the place of Baba’s photo that was worshipped till 1954, a White Italian Marble Baba Statue, chiseled by Balaji Vasant Talim, a celebrated sculptor from Bombay, blessed by Baba, was ceremoniously installed at the hands of Swami Sai Sharananandji (Wamanrao Patel) in October, 1954 and it is this life-like Idol of Baba that is being worshipped since then. It is interesting to note how the Italian Marble Stone which was used for sculpturing Baba’s Life-Like Idol arrived in India. Once in 1952 the Italian Marble Stone arrived at Bombay Port and remained in the dockyard unclaimed by any body and the Port Authorities then conducted an auction in which some one bought it and delivered it to the Shirdi Sansthan. Thus it reached Shirdi miraculously and impressed by the quality of the Italian Marble, the Shirdi Sansthan decided to use it for an Idol of Sai Baba and entrusted the work of sculpting Baba’s Idol to the celebrated sculptor of Bombay, Balaji Vasant Talim. While doing this, he had great difficulty as he was given only a black and white photograph of Baba. He also saw some other photos of Baba. The physical features in all the photos were not identical and he was not sure of the exact physical features of Baba. Based on such photos, it became difficult for him to make the statue with the exact physical features of Baba as he was not aware of the intricate details of Baba’s face and body. Talim got his tools specially made to order from ironsmiths and carpenters and started by first making a Model of Baba’s Idol using mud clay.
<br>
<img src="{% static "images/j1.png" %}" alt="baba" width="200" height="260">
<br>
Therefore, he prayed to Baba, saying “If Shri Sai Baba gives me darshan while making His Statue, the Statue will be worthy & the devotees also will have the feelings of devotion”. One early morning at about 7-00 AM, he entered into his studio and did not switch on the lights and then he saw a brilliant bright light and Baba appeared in the brilliant bright light and gave darshan to him in his studio itself and showed to him his face and body in different angles and advised him to study and remember well all the physical features of his face and body and thereafter his sculpting work flowed easily. Talim also expressed that while sculpting, he was hearing the divine voice of Baba who actually was directing him in sculpting the Statue into a Most Beautiful Idol of Baba. He later on told about this to Shri Sai Narayan Baba. He sculpted the Mud Statue of Baba based on his vision of Baba. The Shirdi Sansthan approved the Mud Statue of Baba and based on this Statue, he carved the Italian Marble Statue of Sai Baba.
<br>
<img src="{% static "images/j2.jpg" %}" alt="baba" width="200" height="260">
<br>
During 1954, Talim while working with the workers, came to the finishing stages of marble Statue of Sai Baba and the Marble Idol was almost ready. But Talim found an Air Pocket below the Left Knee of Baba’s Statue and it required to be removed. Removing an Air Pocket from an almost finished Statue was always risky and dangerous as the removal would result in the entire portion coming down suddenly and the Statue would get broken. At this stage, Talim was very unhappy and stopped the work. He also feared that the entire Statue might get broken and his entire labour and time would become waste. Then he prayed to Baba for his mercy and help. Then he heard a voice, saying, “Balaji, Carry on”. He picked up courage and asked his workers to carry on the work by chiseling out the additional portion of Air Pocket. But all the workers refused to carry out his instructions and did not touch the Statue further. Though nervous, Balaji Talim himself took the chisel and hammer and while praying to Baba and uttering, “Baba help me” gave a small stroke on the air pocket below the Left Knee. And to his great surprise, only the air pocket/additional portion came down, leaving the rest of Baba’s Statue intact. Immediately tears rolled down from Talim’s eyes in extreme ecstasy and he started dancing and also distributed sweets to all.  Thus he experienced a wonderful miracle of Baba and it was Baba who directed Talim at every stage of chiseling work. Talim was a blessed person as he had the darshan of Baba and also heard the divine voice of Baba.
<br>
Thus the Sansthan got it sculptured at the hands of Balaji Vasant Talim into the most beautiful Idol of Baba which was installed in 1954 in the sanctum sanctorum in the Samadhi Mandir.  It is also interesting to note that B.V.Talim did not do any sculpting work after 1954 till his death in 1970 at the age of 82 years as per Baba’s direction as he was a blessed person with highest spiritual attainment. Baba’s Idol was thus installed on 7th Oct, 1954, the Vijayadasami day, exactly after 36 years after Baba’s Mahasamadhi. It is also interesting to note that 36 hours after Baba left his Mortal Coil, the interment of Baba’s Body was complete on early Thursday morning on 17th October, 1918. Blessed was B.V.Talim who had darshan of Baba and who had thus attained beatitude at the holy Feet of Baba.
<br>
The finished Marble Idol of Baba was taken in procession throughout the Shirdi village with pomp and gaiety before installation during 1954. Baba’s Idol is so life-like as if Baba is sitting in the Mandir. Devotees like Swami Sri Sai Sarananandaji, Laxmibai, Saguna Meru Naik and others who saw Baba in Mortal Coil and moved with Baba, felt as if Baba had come back alive in the form of His Idol.
<br>
DATTARAM DWARAKANATH NEROY: D.D.Neroy’s wonderful service of propaganda about Baba by free distribution on several occasions, of Baba’s photos, one sitting on stone and another: Ashirwad photo:
<br>
Shri  Dattaram  Dwarkanath  Neroy   popularly   known  as  D  D  Neroy  was  born on 29th
<br>
February 1896. D D Neroy was born in a large family which consisted of 5 Sisters & 1 brother. He had 2 elder Sisters, while D D Neroy was the third sibling. His father’s name was Shri Dwarkanath Bhau Neroy  who was the founder of D B Neroy & co in 1898. D B Neroy was educated at the Sir. J J school of Art, Mumbai & was soon recognised as pioneer in the art of hand engraving on box wood (Block makers & offset plate makers). Mr. D B Neroy passed away at the young age of 47 due to pneumonia when D.D.Neroy was 22 years old.  Mr. D D Neroy assumed control of the firm being the eldest son.  He immediately set out to equip himself thoroughly by gaining firsthand knowledge in England & Germany, and was a gold medalist from Hamburg.
<br>
D D Neroy was a great devotee of Sai Baba. He visited Shirdi many times as a young lad. In one visit in 1918, he had the grace and blessings of SAINATH at Shirdi. and it was a “Sakshatkar” of  Sai Baba, his guru and perfect master whose directions he followed meticulously as a humble devotee. D D Neroy took the photo of Baba sitting on stone which was an original one as it contained his signature also on the photo(see in the photo). The dimensions of this original photograph of Sai Baba sitting on stone are 6’ by 4’.
<br>
The Ashirwad photo (given below) was painted by notable artist Dr. S M Pandit. D.D. Neroy made blocks and printed several copies  of   photos  of   Baba   sitting  on stone and Baba's
<br><img src="{% static "images/j3.jpg" %}" alt="baba" width="200" height="260">
<br>
Ashirwad photo. Though Ashirwad photo was painted by Dr.S.M.Pandit, D.D.Neroy took up the task of making the block and printing several copies. He made mass distribution of such photo prints of Baba sitting on stone and Ashirwad photo. He used to donate several prints of Baba’s  both photos to the Sai Sansthan, Shirdi every year. His mission was just to distribute, distribute and distribute Baba’s blessings in the form of photographs to reach families/homes all over India and to reach Baba’s blessings to all corners of the world. Thus D.D.Neroy was instrumental in propagating about Baba through these two varieties of photos.  Baba’s photographs were never sold but were always distributed freely by him.
<br>
The story of photograph of BABA SITTING ON THE STONE, for which D D Neroy made blocks and prints thereof, was a transcendental and mystical occurrence kept between Sai Baba and D D Neroy. The transcendental and mystical occurrence was kept secret about which he did not talk much and which he did not make public perhaps due to Sai Baba’s wishes.
<br>
D D Neroy also made many photo prints of Baba with one of the eleven sayings printed below them. Usually he would write, "If you look to Me, I look to you ".  This photo was taken with the consent of Baba by Sri D.D.Neroy. D D Neroy had signed only one photo of Baba and this photo is placed in the Mangal Karyalay of Shri Sai Baba Sansthan, Shirdi.
<br>
D D Neroy lived at the gallery premises and made short visits to his home at Khotachi Wadi, Mumbai where entire family lived together.  Home cooked food was sent by his wife Anandibai morning and evening regularly. He had two male servants Gangaram & Vishram who stayed with him and even made arrangements for sleeping in this workplace. D D Neroy was also closely associated with the famous artists of Mumbai Shri  S M Pandit, Mulgaonkar, Hebbar, B.V.Talim, to name a few. These artists painted for D D Neroy to make blocks of their paintings. D D Neroy used to visit Shirdi regularly even after Baba’s Maha Samadhi and used to distribute Baba’s Photographs to devotees. The family is still continuing this legacy left behind  by D.D.Neroy.
<img src="{% static "images/j4.jpg" %}" alt="baba" width="200" height="260">
<br>

He was also devoted to Kamu Baba, a saint at Girgaum, Mumbai. D.D.Neroy got the portrait of Baba sitting on the stone made and mounted it in an ornate frame. Then with the help of four men, he took it to Girgaum and offered it to his Guru. Kamu Baba appreciated the portrait and the kind gesture, but refused to accept it. He told D D Neroy to take it to Shirdi, and place it in the Sabhamandap of the Dwarakamai. Dejected he sat at his Guru’s feet and said “it took me three years to make this portrait and one and a half months to get it framed. Never mind the expense, now you reject it?”. To this, Kamu Baba calmly said that it was not a question of rejecting it, but my keen desire in asking him to take it to Shirdi and place it in the Sabhamandap in the Dwarakamai where several devotees would have the benefit of seeing and praying to it.  Thus, this portrait came to be installed in the Sabhamandap of the Dwarakamai (see the side picture). This was the original Photograph which was taken with Baba's consent.
<br>
The ancestral Neroy house at Khotachi Wadi, Girgaum, Mumbai stands tall & strong, where today, the fourth generation family members of the Neroy household still reside. Subhashchandra Dattaram Neroy further took up and carried ahead the family business but passed away in 2012, leaving behind his wife Mrs.Rohini Subhashchandra Neroy. Their  eldest  daughter  Mrs. Ghayathri Neroy Desai, and two  Sons Sundeep S Neroy & Ram S Neroy who today continue the family business of Block Making & offset processing while the daughter runs the art gallery business in the name & style of R D D Neroy Gallery in the same premises where D D Neroy’s business began in the beginning.
<br>

Smt. Ghayathri the granddaughter of Shri. D D Neroy confirms that the photograph is an original one and it has the signature of her grandfather.  She also states that over the years, many people have successfully removed the signature with the use of latest technology and are selling the photographs as the original photograph of Sai Baba. Even to this day, if anybody visits the Gallery, they can see the beautiful painting of Sainath Ashirwad by Shri S.M.Pandit having the copyright stamp of D D Neroy. Baba’s photographs were never sold but were always distributed. D.D.Neroy photo can be seen with Anandibai Neroy, his spouse. In the side picture. Blessed was the family full of devotees of Baba.
