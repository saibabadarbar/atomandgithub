 <h2>Chronology of the life of Shirdi Sai Baba</h2><hr>
 <h4><strong>Before arriving Shiridi</strong></h4>
 <p style="color:white;"><strong>Many devotees raise the doubt about where was saibaba before arriving shiridi</strong>

   There is no proof about saibaba birth or religion,throughout baba life he kept this as secret.However some sources says he is born to a brahmin family and later they left him and a muslim took incharge of baba
     <br>
     <strong><ins>Around-1839-51 </ins></strong><br>
Sai Baba spent 12 years with his Guru. The name of his Guru was Gopal Rao Deshmukh (Venkusa, also known as Venkavadhuta) ) of Selu. Some say " Baba practiced penance at
the tomb of His Guru in the cellar under the Neem Tree at Shirdi". Arrival of Devidas
 at Shirdi (Aged 10-11 years) took place in 1846. When he enquired, BABA mentioned the name of his GURU as Venkusa implying VISHNU (Parvardigar).<br>
<strong><ins>1851</ins></strong><br>
Sai Baba first appeared at Shirdi and stays in the village for two months. He is noted to reside day and night under a Neem Tree (aged about 16 Years) which he claims is growing over the tomb of his old guru. After two months Baba disappeared to an unknown place. <br>
<strong><ins>ca. 1855-1857</ins></strong><br>
Sai Baba travels about from place to place and some resources says baba took alms and was wondering in outskirts of villages and during nights few villegers
got scared looking at baba in white cloths and long hair thinking as ghost, baba decided to leave the villages and started staying in forests and finally ends up
 in Dhoopkheda (or Dhoop) in Aurangabad District.<br><br>
 <img src="{% static "images/chand.jpg" %}" alt="baba" width="330" height="230">
 <img src="{% static "images/chandhome.gif" %}" alt="baba" width="230" height="230">
 <br><br><p style="color:white;">
A Moslem called Chandubhai patel came to the forest searching
      for his horse, which was lost. He was startled to see Sri Sai Baba, staying all-alone under the shade of a tree in that thick forest, where no man treads.Then baba called him and said i am poor
       fakir who lives here in this forest. <br>Do not fear. Have no apprehensions in your mind. Come here and have a puff of this chillim,” said Baba.

Chandubhai’s mind quietened on hearing Baba speak. He slowly drew near Baba and sat. Baba was readying the chillim for smoking. Chandubhai took the chillim from him and after powdering
 the tobacco leaf, packed it firmly into the chillim. He said, “ I have filled and readied the chillim. But there is no fire. I have left my flints at home. What are we to do now?” Baba laughed
  on hearing Chandubhai. He said, “Chandubhai, your eyes and brain are struggling breathlessly entangled in the worldly. Fire is the basis and foundation of the entire world.
   It is spread all over the universe. Why are you lamenting that there is no fire?” Baba took his satka (stick) which was constantly with him and smote the ground.
    Instantly the fire was visible on the ground. Baba placed a twig on the fire and lit the chillim with the burning twig. He threw the twig away after the chillim was well
     lit and drawing satisfactorily. Chandubhai was stunned by this display of Baba’s power. He immediately placed his head on Baba’s feet in devotion and respect.
      He said, “Maharaj, your power is great. You are none other than the Paigambar (God). It is the accumulated merit of my past lives which has given me the great good fortune of your darshan.
       I have been searching without food for more than 20 days for my horse which was lost. It was a valuable, pedigreed horse from Turkey. It has an excellent gait.
        It had gone for feeding and lost its way. After I lost that excellent horse I have lost all taste for food. I have searched the whole forest many times but I have not been able to trace it
        . Even this chillim will not be to my taste, If I cannot find the horse.” Sai Baba said, “Why do you worry so for such a small thing? Go and see beside that thicket.
         You will see your horse feeding on grass there. Do not worry so about the horse.Chandubhai was ecstatic with happiness seeing his horse again after a long time. He caught the horse with on
         e hand and neared Sri Sai Baba. He said, “Baba! Please sit in my cart and come to my house. My household and I will be blessed by your arrival.” Baba smiled, “What am I, a poor fakir, to
         do with a horse and a cart, my son? I cannot come today to your house in any case. Let us see, I may come either tomorrow or the day after. Do not unnecessar
         ily force me to come today.” Chandubhai saluted Baba’s feet and riding his horse went home elated at finding his horse again.

<br>Next day Baba went to Chandbhai's house and spend few days with them and soon he found everybody in a very joyful mood and festivities going on all around. He found that Chandbhai's wife's nephew was getting married. The bride was from Shirdi and the marriage party was going to Shirdi.
 Chandbhai invited Baba to accompany the marriage party to Shirdi. At Shirdi they camped in a field next to Khandoba's temple.
<br>
          <br> <strong><ins>1858</ins></strong><br>
         Sai Baba returns to Shirdi along with the marriage-party of Chand Patil and remained at Shirdi for ever till His Samadhi. <br><br>

 <img src="{% static "images/kan.jpg" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="230"><br>Kandoba temple. <br>

After reaching Shirdi, the procession put a camp in the outskirts of shiridi, in front of the Khandoba Temple. This temple was owned by a Sonar (goldsmith) Bhagat Mhalsapati.
 looking at the Fakir getting down from the bullock-cart,
 Mahalsapati spontaneously uttered, <strong>“Aao Sai (Welcome Sai)!”.</strong>
 <img src="{% static "images/maha3.jpg" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="230">
 <img src="{% static "images/maha.jpg" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="230"><br>
  And the Fakir came to be known by that name thereafter.
  <br><strong>Mahalsapati- priest at a local temple is believed as the first devotee of sai Baba of Shirdi.</strong>
  <br>  <br><h4>Early days in shiridi</h4><p style="color:white;"> Baba came to village Shirdi in Maharastra at age of 16.For about five years of time Baba took his accommodation
     under the neem tree and very often Baba used to wander in the jungle near Shirdi and was very
  uncommunicative as Baba spent lot of his time in meditation.

<h4>Significance of the Neem Tree</h4><hr>
<p style="color:white;" >Shri Sai Baba was first seen in shiridi sitting under the Neem tree when he was just 16 years of age.The
 peole of the village were wonder-struck to see such a young lad practicing hard penance, not minding heat and cold.
He went to nobody's door, but always sat near the neem tree.
Young 'Sai Baba'(even this title was not conferred on him by that time) stayed under neem tree for
about three years but suddenly left shiridi.No one knew where he went or why, After a
 year or so, he again returned to shiridi and stayed here
  till his mahasamadhi in 1918 i.e,, for sixty years. <br>Baba told the villagers that under the Neem tree was his
  Guru'samadhi(shrine).
  <p style="color:white;" >
  <br>Even after his second advent at Shiridi, Sai baba seemed to have lived under the neem tree for some time ansa
  particular incident was responsible for Baba's changing his residence to the old dilapidated mosque in the village.
  The details of the incidents are as follows:<br><hr>
  <strong> "Once there was very heavy rains at Shiridi and a large portion of it was flooded.After a long while some of his very early Devotees
    like shyama,mahalsapathi, bhaijamai etc.. remembered the homeless fakir and wanted to see where he took shelter from the rain.Mahalsapathi and a few others rushed to the margosa tree and were stunned to see that Sai Baba was there under the same tree, half-reclining,
    in the state of samadhi.Water flowed all over him. All the rubbish and filth gathered over his body.They dared not wake him up from that state.
    A few hours later, when the water had drained away,
    they returned to see him still lying on the damp earth; his body and face were completely covered with mud deposited by the receding water.

    They felt guilty at their gross neglect of Baba's welfare when he was their sole protector and guide.

    Later, when Baba returned to conciousness, these devotees persuaded him to take shelter in the small, dilapidated mud-built mosque in the village."</strong>
</p>
    <img src="{% static "images/olddwaraka.jpg" %}" alt="baba" width="350" height="260"> <br>old dwarakamai<br><hr>

<p style="color:white;" >Baba always used to sit under the neem tree. In most religions, the tree symbolizes the
  whole creation because both havetheir roots hidden from our immediate perception; both are ever growing, renewing
   themselves, putting from new and different forms and shedding the old.
<br>
<br>This Masjid that Baba extolled was old and dilapidated. There were deep pits and huge holes in the floor. Each and every nook and corner had
garbage dumped in it. It was in this ambience that he stayed, blissfully smoking his Chillim, by day and night.
  </p><p style="color:white;">
    On his body were torn and tattered clothes, and it was impossible for the people to recognize his divinity. Often he roamed in the forests nearby. There he would sit under the Babul Tree (a small tree full of thorns),
    often talking to some unknown entity and waving his hands about in a threatening manner. The villagers saw his lifestyle and took little notice of him.
  <br>
  The only time they interacted with him was when someone in the family was sick and they needed some medicines. Baba dispensed his medicines readily. If the patient did not recover quickly, he himself went and nursed him back to health.
  <br> Bayajabai, wife of village chief occasionally enquired about the welfare of the sai Baba in his childhood. Gradually she started bringing food to Baba. As the days passed baba started
  treating her as his mother. Mhalspati, the village chief and a priest, once possessed by lord khandoba, uttered that there is a holy spirit here pointing towards the Sai Baba.
<br> Gradually Baba shifted his accommodation to a nearby mosque. Yet he named that mosque Dwarakamai, a decidedly Hindu name, and is said to have had substantial knowledge of the Puranas, the Bhagavadgita,
 and various branches of Hindu thought.
 <br>

 Baba’s divinity dawned on the villagers only after Gangagiri Maharaj had told the villagers about Baba’s superhuman powers and divinity,  “He is a valuable diamond lying in a heap of rubbish. It is your good fortune that he has come to stay amongst you”.
 <br>
 The Sadguru manifests to uplift his devotees. His only concern is their welfare in every aspect of life.
  He is eager that they progress spiritually and
  that they are filled with love, and bliss. The devotees are also eager to do Guru Seva, charitable deeds, and fulfill his wishes.
 <br>
  In the mosque Baba maintained sacred fire which was called dhuni. Baba gave sacred ash to the entire visitor. People believe that ash is
  the best medicine to heal for all health issues.
At first denounced by the villagers of Shirdi as a madman, by the turn of the century Sai Baba had a considerable following of Hindus
and Muslims, attracted by his compelling teachings and his performance of apparent miracles, which often involved the granting of wishes and the healing of the sick. He wore a Muslim cap and for the better part
of his life lived in an abandoned mosque in Shirdi
  <br><br>
  <strong>His religion, philosophy and practices.</strong> <br>
Sai left no written records, but a strong oral legacy of teachings and parables. This sayings and teaching have
 been written down by his disciples. One of his favourite teachings was the omnipresence of God – “Why do you fear when I am always here. He has no beginning and no end.” <br>

  <br>One day god khandobha possessed mahalsapathi and pointed
towards the neem tree and  asked to dig it to roots. The villagers followed the words of Baba and started digging it. As the layers of earth passed on, they found a slab made of stone, oil lamps glowing without any oil and air too, Which was completely opposite to science. In the same place they found a vessel which is in the shape of cow mouth on a wooden table. Baba clarified that this is the holy place where his guru had done penance. He also suggested that instead of worshipping me(sai baba), worship the tree and leave it untouched. Till today no one touched it. This tree is the first stop of a pilgrim in shirdi. <br>

Baba was an unique personality who earned a huge attention towards him, in the day time he was not associated with any one and not afraid of any one.
Some people thought that he was mad and even hurt him physically by throwing stones at him.
<br>
<br>Meeting Shyama Alias Madhavarao Deshpande:One day Mahalsapathi came with a man to baba, at that time baba was playing with kids.
Mahalsapthi said to shyama alot about baba as a incarnation of god.They both looking at baba, baba was lost in the game
<br>

Shyama thought in mind he cant even win a game and people think about him as god, baba knowing inner feelings of madhavrao addressed him as
to make my children win i should loose my game "SHYAMA".He was wonderstruck as this name was given to him by his mother as he was born with blessings of lord
krishna and only she used to call him with that name during his childhood and no body know about this.<br>

This moment made him think he is not less a God.<br>

Shyama was a school teacher at that time, this school is situated very close to Dwarakamai where Sai Baba lived. Shyama used to teach the kids in day time and he will sleep at night in the school
itself. <br>

When ever he hear’s some sound, he used to look at Baba through the ventilator. Baba will be talking to himself in different languages, sometimes, Sai will be laughing, moving his fingers and acting
 as if he is speaking to someone sitting in front of him but no one will be present there. At times, Sai gets angry and also do other curious things. <br><br>

It was Sai’s early times in Shirdi. No one in village respected him.Every one in Shirdi thought Saibaba is a mad fakir simply staying in Masjid and running his life talking alms and eating that food. <br>

Shyama looking at Baba speaking to himself thought he is a mad fakir but he will be surprised how can this poor fakir with no education speak English and other unknown languages
 ( Sai used to speak many languages). <br>

Gradually, he realized Sai is God incarnate and a true Saint. <br>

During early times, Only three people were Sai’s ardent devotees – Shyama , the priest of Khandoba temple – Mahalsapati and a tailor, Bhaijamai and very few more. <br>

Shyama always wanted to ask to Saibaba about his strange behavior’s at night and din’t had courage. Those days people had fear on saints and will be careful in what they ask and expect from them. <br>

Once Shyama was massaging Sai’s legs at night. He asked <br>

“Baba, You don’t seem to sleep at all at nights. You are laughing to yourself or talking. What is the secret of all this?<br>
Sai told him <br>

“Shyama, What you think? That you are my only person about whom I am concerned in this world? There are numerous persons who are praying me. I am speaking to all of them. <br><br>

When I turn my finger, I am turning their minds.<br>
When I move my lips, I am talking to them. <br>
When I laugh, I am amused at their follies ( unpractical desires and plans, foolishness ) <br><br>

This way, I am taking care of every devotee who surrenders his/her heart and soul to me.” <br>

Listening to this, Shyama was surprised and realized the holiness of Sai maharaj.  We must note that thought those days Sai had only handful of devotees, he has told Shyama that numerous people pray to
 him. This shows that Sai is really avatar of Lord Dattatreya and he receives millions of prayers every second.  Sai responds to every true, sincere prayer of devotees. <br>

Shyama told “Baba, my teaching work doesn’t take much of my time. Let me stay with you in Dwarakamai and serve you” <br>

Sai happily allowed him to serve him. <br>

Shyama served Saibaba with so much intimacy for rest of his life and enjoyed the divine presence near him.


<br><br>
Bhagoji Shinde: <br>
 <img src="{% static "images/babahealing.jpg" %}" alt="maha" width="330" height="230"> <br>
<br>
In the year 1861, during the rainy season, there was a severe cyclone. The small hut in which a leper named Bhagoji Shinde lived was swept away by the cyclone. A shivering Bhagoji approached
 some unknown persons for shelter, but none gave him shelter in their house fearing that they may contact leprosy. Not knowing what to do,
 he proceeded towards the mosque where Sai was, with the hope that Sai would come to his rescue. But on the way , due to severe cold and rain he fell down crying "Sai". Sai immediately ran
 towards him, lifted him and carried him on his shoulders to the mosque. A fire was required immediately to keep Bhagoji warm. But no fire could be lit in that severe cyclone. So Baba called
 Mother Dwarakamai who was in the underground structure near the neem tree, in the form of a jyoti. Immediately Dwarakamai,in an invisible form , came and lighted the firewood in the mosque.
  Bhagoji regained consciousness after getting warmth from the fire in the mosque. <br>
<br>When Bhagoji came in contact with Baba he had black leprosy so outwardly he looked, miserable and unfortunate. He was indeed very fortunate to do seva and be with Baba constantly. <br>

Once when Baba thrust his hand into the dhuni (the sacred fire) and was badly burnt (thus saving the life of a devotees' baby), Bhagoji was allowed to clean and dress the wound with a bandage. Even
though Baba lived for a further eight years after the incident, Bhagoji would daily continue the ritual of bandaging Baba's arm long after it had healed. <br>

His elder brother Raguji says, “Once Bhagoji was suffering from high fever and he was at deaths door and Baba came to our home. He branded Bhagoji with a hot iron rod on his back and temples and he recovered soon after”  It is said that once Baba asked Bhagoji to ask for a boon, of being cured of his Leprosy, however Bhagoji said, “Baba I am not concerned about my physical appearance, or my disease. But I would like you to me this wish, which is that I be allowed to be with you at all times and that I be allowed to come to the Dwarka Mai whenever I wish” and Baba granted him the wish.<br>

Thus Bhagoji was the first person to enter the Dwarka Mai early in the morning when Baba sat in front of the Dhuni, and massage Baba’s burnt hand. After doing his seva he would prepare Baba’s
 chillum for Him and they would smoke it together. And only after Bhagoji left would the other devotees be allowed to come up. This seva he did without fail every day till 1918. <br>

Bhagoji had the good fortune of holding the ornamental umbrella for Baba when Baba went to Lendi Baugh. Thus Baba immortalized him because he is seen in the photograph behind Baba holding the
 umbrella. And when the devotee sees that photo years later they will remember him.  <br>
 <img src="{% static "images/umbre.jpg" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="230"> <br>
Bhagoji's house, known as Shinde Wada, is just behind Laxmibai's house. This house is on the right hand side of the "Palkhi Road". It is close to the corner where the palanquin turns while going
towards Tajim Khan's darga. The compound of Shinde Wada lies on the right hand side
behind a solid old wooden door. <br>

<img src="{% static "images/wood.jpg" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="230"> <br>
There are many lesson to be learnt from the life of this remarkable devotee. Bhagoji had transcended body consciousness. He was the least concerned about how he looked he had lost most of the fingers of his hand, and also a part of his nose, and the nose is a prominent feature of the face. Although his body oozed pus and blood, that was fowl smelling he was not unconcerned about the sneers and disgusted looks that the others gave him, nor did the unkind words of people have an effect on him. This is the state of complete "Stitha Pragjna" (equanimity). He was determined to do seva for his Sadguru come what may and he persevered. Never once did he fail to come to massage Baba’s burnt hand regardless of the bitter cold or torrential rain. This is “Druda Buddhi”. In the Nava Vidha Bhakti, Bhagoji is an apt example of “Daasya”  or all kinds of seva to the Sadguru. Bhagoji had surrendered totally at his Sadguru’s feet and thus he was able to soak up Baba’s divine energy by being in His Divine presence, and also being able to touch Him and Baba transferred His divine energy to Bhagoji Shinde’s very soul. <br

<br> <br>
Shirdi village became famous because of Sai Baba. He was highly intellectual and good-natured. He had no love for material things, but was always thinking of Atma. His heart was as clear as a mirror. He never bowed to desires. He never differentiated between the rich and the poor. Though he was living at Shirdi, he knew what was happening at distant places.
 Though he had all the powers (siddhis) at his feet, he never used them. <br>
 The mere touch of Sai’s feet will detach us from worldly attachments and help us in getting Atma Sakshatkara ( self-realisation ). His Pada Tirth (water with which his feet are washed ) has the power of destroying the evil forces. His udi (vibhuti) will cure all types of ailments. His order or command is like one from the Vedas. He never appeared tired. He never
  exhibited displeasure or overjoy. He was always in a happy mood. Everyone realised this true state of Sai Baba soon.<br>

<br>
Sai Miracle Of Turning Water Into Oil <br>
 <img src="{% static "images/babadiyas.jpg" %}" alt="maha" width="330" height="230"> <br>
One of the most talked about Sai Baba miracles is the story about when he turned water into oil to light up the lamps in Shirdi <br>

Most devotees of Shri Sai Baba know about his miracles through the holy book Shri Sai Satcharitra written by Hemadpant. One of the most famous stories in this holy manuscript that chronicles Sai Stories is about turning water into oil and this story has been used to dramatic effect in some movies and TV serials about Shirdi Sai Baba. The is the story of His lighting the lamps using water instead of oil. No mean feat indeed and nothing short of a true miracle.
<br>
It was known to all that Shri Sai Baba loved lighting diyas or lamps in Dwarkamai. He would ask the locals for oil and would keep these lamps lit throughout the night. One day, the local shopkeepers of Shirdi got irked by this seemingly unnecessary expense. So they decided that they shall refuse to give oil to Him. Obviously, these locals were neither devotees of Sai, nor were they even aware of the spiritual siddhis of Sai Baba.
<br>
Baba was undaunted. He prepared the lamps with cotton wicks and then filled His tumrel, which still had a few drops of oil, with water. He sipped from this concoction, and He also poured it into the many lamps filled with wicks. He then lit the wicks. Lo and behold, the lamps started to burn and stayed lit throughout the night. A lesson learnt by the shopkeepers!
<br>
So this is the famous Sai story about Sai Baba lighting lamps using water by turning oil into water in Shirdi.
<br>
<br>Saibaba Bhiksha:  It is endless to take about saibaba food : <br>
 <img src="{% static "images/babaalms.jpg" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="230"> <br>

<br>During Shirdi Saibaba’s life time, he used to take alms from 5 houses: <br>
 (1) Ganapathi Rao’s son Tatya Patil  <br>
 (2) Vaman Sakharam  <br>
 (3) Nandu Savai Rama Vani <br>
 (4) Madhava Rao Deshpande (Shama) and <br>
 (5) Appaji Patil..  <br>

 Sai used to stand infront of these houses and loudly call for Bhiksha. The womens gives him any food they have at
 home to share with Sai.
 <br>In one hand he carried a tin-pot for liquid or semi-liquid food items such as soup, vegetables, milk or buttermilk and in other hand a cloth bag to receive bread, cooked rice and solid food items.
  Baba’s tongue knew no taste as he had acquired full control over it.
  Irrespective of the taste all the food collected was mixed together of which
  he would distribute to some devotees,
  dogs and birds around and partake a small quantity from the rest over.
  Baba will bring it to Dwarakamai and keep it in a plate which will be free for
  any one to take.
   Even the Dogs were happily fed by baba. What ever little is remaining was taken
    by Sai for himself. <br>
There were few days when Saibaba used to get ill. When ever some devotee says that he/she is having unbearable problem, Sai has ability to take it on to his own body. <br>

Sometimes, Sai naturally gets sick and could not even eat but he never left his habit of talking alms.
<br>
It was sometime before 1910 when the crowd from Mumbai and across Maharastra started coming to Shirdi. Once a devotee by name purandre was in Shirdi when Sai was sick. Sai could not even walk to talk alms and to lendi ( garden). Purandre used to carry him on his back and slowly take baba. Looking at Saibaba’s health condition, Purandre used to shed tears and Sai consoles him not to worry.
<br>
I read this beautiful incident in a book and wanted to express two things
<br>
1. Many of us think Sai has so many devotees and he’s happy and not bothering us.

Sai may be a saint be he also has problems when he was in human form and also after his samadhi. Now what all we do to him? Just because Sai can’t directly scold us, we do all shorts of stupidity to Sai and he is bearing it all because he loves us.

Sai himself suffers when we suffer. This is why we must not worry much. I keep worrying about my life and I know Sai is hurt by my behavior because he lives in the same heart where I worry. We must try to live with confidence even when life doesn’t grant us what we desire. I say this advice to other sai devotees but I myself find it hard to follow.

Sometimes, I do forget my worries and make fun and laugh and I feel Saibaba is happy about it. <br>

2. The fact that Sai went to take alms even when he can’t even walk shows his love for people who depend on him. When you worry that he doesn’t bless you with good Career, Job, money, relationship and health. Trust him whole heartedly because this is a Saint who took alms to feed his children. He can’t let his loved ones in pain for long.

Sai will surely show you a way and make you happy.
<br>
Today I got a dream about a sacred river that someone falls down into the river from a hill. Even then they are not hurt. Then I see someone at work asking me you have lost all your hair and I say ya I did. Then I many of my friends at work and there was some politician. I also saw someone whom I respect at work but I really don’t understand all these dreams.
<br>
I hugged Sai Satcharitra and slept and don’t know what Sai wants from me.
<br><strong>1865</strong> <br>
Saint Manik Prabhu of Homanabad in Bidar District of Karnataka passed away in 1878, Chaitra Vadya 14.  H. H. Akkalkot Swami left His mortal coil at Akkalkot in Solapur District of Maharashtra. (First appeared in 1835). It is reported that three of them (Manik Prabhu, Swami Samartha and SAIBABA) met at Humanabad.
<br><strong>
1885</strong> <br>
Saint Anandnath (aged 95 years) of Yewala Math and a disciple of Akkalkot Swami visited Shirdi and seeing Sai Baba exclaimed, "This is a precious real diamond."
In the earlier days, Gowli Buva, who was a staunch devotee of Vittal, had expressed about Sai Baba as follows: "Baba has come into this world for the sake of orphans
and the downtrodden." At one time Baba had a bout of wrestling with Mohiuddin Tamboli and pretended to lose. But from that day the egoism in Mohiuddin was removed and he
stopped wrestling bouts, slowly working towards self-realisation ( Atma Sakshatkara )
. <br>
<br>
Sleeping in Dwarakamai <br>
Let us first see where and how Baba slept, Mr. Nanasaheb Dengale brought, for Sai Baba, a wooden plank, amount 4 cubits in length and only a span in breath, for sleeping upon. Instead of keeping the plank on the floor and then sleeping on it, Baba tied it like a swing to the rafters of the Masjid with old shreds or rags and commenced to sleep upon it. The rags were so thin and worn out that it was a problem how they could bear or support even weight of the plank itself, let alone the weight of Baba. But somehow or other-it was Baba's sheer Leela that the worn out rags did sustain the plank, with the weight of Baba on it. On the four corners of this plank, Baba lighted panatis (earthen lamps), one at each corner, and kept them burning the whole night. It was a sight for the Gods to see Baba sitting or sleeping on this plank! It was a wonder to all, how Baba got up and down the plank. Out of curiosity, many careful observers kept watching the process of mounting and dismounting, but none succeeded. As crowds began to swell so to detect this wonderful feat, Baba one day broke the plank into pieces and threw it away.
Baba had all the eight Siddhis (powers) at His command. He never practiced nor craved for them. They came to Him naturally, as a result of His perfection. <br>

This image of Sai - sitting in concentration on that plank or sleeping on it, with diyas at the foot of this bed and at the head of the plank - is a picture that most people recall as an iconic image
 of Sai Baba. To this day, people wonder how Sai Baba managed to climb on it, let alone sit or sleep on it.
At that time, it piqued everybody's curiosity; people started flocking to the mosque at night to see this curved and suspended plank for themselves. Soon the curious crowded that would come to visit
Sai Baba's bed became a nuisance and disturbed Baba's sleep, not to mention the peaceful environment of a mosque where one comes for meditative peace and quiet. So one day, Sai grew tired of the
 attention / disturbance around it, dismantled and let go of this bed. But if you go to the Shirdi Dwarkamai, you will still be able to see where the bed was placed, just ahead of the Nimbar and after the Dhuni. Jai Sai Ram.

  <br>Religious View Of Sai Baba Of Shirdi <br>
 Baba was completely opponent to orthodoxy, Hinduism, Christianity and muslim. Baba asked his devotees to lead a ordinary life. He asked his followers to chant holy words ,god's name and asked his devotees to read their respective holy books. He followed all hindu rituals and permitted muslims to follow Namaz, reading of Quran at festival times

<br>  <strong> <br>One of his well known epigrams, "Sabka Malik Ek " ("One God governs all"). <br>

 He always uttered "Allah Malik"("God is King"). <br><br></strong>
 Lendi Baug <br>
 <img src="{% static "images/babalendi.jpg" %}" alt="maha" width="380" height="230"> <br>
 At some distance from Gurusthan there is the Lendi Baug. Lendi Baug was made and watered daily by Baba himself. It got its name from a Nalla (a drain) which used to previously flow there. Baba used to come here every morning and afternoon and rest under a Neem tree.Sai Baba dug a pit, 2 feet deep, under the Neem tree and kept a Deep(earthen lamp) lit in that pit. One octangular Deepgriha called Nanda Deep has been built in marble stone in memory of this place.
<br>
 It constantly burns in a glass box. On one side of the Deepgriha is a Peepal tree and on the other side is a Neem tree. Some distance away is a Datta Mandir below an Audumbar tree. In the Mandir there is a statue of Datta built in marble stone. The statue of Datta was installed on 6th December, 1976. Just behind the Datta Mandir is a Samadhi of the horse, Shyamsundar which belonged to Baba and which used to bow to him. Lendi Baug also has a well which was dug by Baba and his devotees.

 <br>
 At the entrance of the Baug are the Samadhi's of ardent Sai devotees Tatya Kote Patil, Bhau Maharaj Kumbhar, Nanavalli and Abdul Baba.
<br>
Dhuni <br>

<img src="{% static "images/dhuni.jpg" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="230"> <br>
For many visitors, the dhuni is the most significant part of Dwarkamai, as it is so intimately associated with Baba. The dhuni is the sacred, perpetually burning fire that Baba built and which
has been maintained ever since, though today the fire is much bigger and is enclosed behind a wire cage. <br>

Baba would sometimes apply udi to his devotees when they arrived, or when they were taking leave of him, and he
 often gave out handfuls which he scooped up from the dhuni. The Sri Sai Satcharitra tells us that "when Baba was
  in a good mood" he sometimes used to sing about udi "in a tuneful voice and with great joy": "Sri Ram has come,
  Oh he has come during his wanderings and he has brought bags full of udi." Udi is still collected from the fire for
  distribution. Since this is a continuation of Baba's own practice, and the udi comes from the very fire that Baba himself
  lit and tended, it is considered extremely sacred. Today a small tray of udi is kept for visitors near the steps. <br>

When Baba returned from his morning begging rounds with a cloth bag of food and a tin pot of liquids,
 he would first offer some of it at the dhuni before taking any himself.  <br>

<br> Radhakrishamai <br>
One evening, in 1907 Sai Baba was sitting in Dwarkamai, with his hand leaning on the wooden rest. The sun was moving slowly towards the setting point. The cattle were moving towards their
shade after grazing in the nearby fields. At that time, at near distant was a building called Chavadi. The building was in a dilapidated condition. More than that all the sides
were open. One could see the horizon from the Masjid Mai or Dwaraka Mai. Around the Dwarka Mai there was no fencing of any kind. At that time Sai Baba’s eyes saw at a distance, a figure,
clad in white clothes, moving towards Dwarkamai.
<br><br>
Sai Baba kept on gazing in that direction, as if waiting for someone. As the figure came closer and closer one could see that it was a female, in white clothes. A cloth bag was hanging on the
back of her shoulder. In one hand was an ektara, a musical instrument similar to guitar, with just one string. And in other hand was kartaal yet another musical instrument.
On her forehead was a tilak according to Madhva Sampradaya, a long line with black colore and on both the hands were bangles made of Tulsi beads.
Also the neck was decorated with Tulsi garland. The dark hair was hanging from her head, reaching below her knees. As she came nearer to Dwarkamai,
all the eyes fell on her. Though the clothes she wore were not very tidy, one could see the charm in her face, which would demand respect at once. <br><br>

Reaching near Dwarkamai the lady unburdened her shoulder by putting the cloth bag on the land of Shirdi. She also put off the musical instruments from her hands. Without climbing up
the stairs of Dwarka Mai, the lady bowed down, touched her head on the sacred land of Shirdi and then joining both her hands, she did Namaskar to Sri Sai Baba, who was sitting in Masjidmai.
 From her cloth bag she took out a beautiful idol of Radha Krishna. ( Krishna symbolizes God and Radha the lover of God, the name of Radha (lover of God) is taken before the name of God in
  Hindu tradition, signifying the importance of God lover, such lovers of God are rare, who craves for Only God’s Love). The beautiful metallic idol was of brass, of about 9 inches
  in size, she gathered two bricks from around, placed them together, covered them with a vastra (piece of neat cloth), placed the idol over it and sat with the Kartaal in her hand. <br><br>

Along with the music she began to sing with a pain in her heart. The high pitch voice was singing and calling for God. Saying that the name of Ram is in my mind, how do I please Ram (God) O Sai,
I am weak with the karmas, how do I sing the glory of God O Sai. She sung a Bhajan by Mira Bai, the notes she sang seemed to become one with Krishna (Mira Bai’s love for God was God in form of Krishna).
 All the notes seemed to be merging and melting in Krishna, such was the love and pain flowing through her heart for God, while she was singing. People of Shirdi, attracted by the music and pitiful and
  melodious songs, sung in a high pitch, began to gather near Dwarka Mai. As the bhajans were sung, the people were wrapped by the magic of it. They forgot time; they forgot their daily hassles
  of life. The hearts of the listeners were experiencing something which they could not understand nor could they explain.
   The earthen lamps lit with oil, began to get dim, yet nobody’s mind and heart was getting ready to mend them, such was the environment created.
   The bhajans continued till midnight. Sai Baba did not leave his Asan (seat), people forgot sleep. Even the beloved devotees of Sai Baba, Tatya Patil and Mahalsapati were rapt in the environment. <br><br>

After some time, the lady came back from Samadhi. Sai Baba while giving blessings said, “Go! The school (situated between Masjid Mai and Chavadi) is vacant, and stay there.” After the arrival of
 Sundaribai Kshirsagar in Shirdi, because of her devotion towards Radha Krishna, people of Shirdi started calling her as Radhakrishna Mai. Shirdi Sai Baba used to call her Radhakrishni,
  sometimes Sai Baba would even call her as Avdasa. Gradually the original name Sundaribai Kshirsagar was erased from people’s mind and Radhakrishna Mai was how she was popularly known as
   and called by the people of Shirdi and the visitors of Shirdi. Radhakrishna Mai always used to wear thick clothes, the clothes used to be stark clean. The hair on the head used to be
   free and untied, sometimes were tied in knots. In her kutir (small thatched home) would be bed covered with a clean bedsheet and a mosquito net over it.
    On the small platform for devotion and prayers was a clean gadi (small mattress), on which was placed the nine inch beautiful idol of Radha Krishna,
    made of brass. On both sides of the idol were beautiful pictures of Sai Baba, on which the garland of flowers were adorned,
    and on both the sides were placed pillows with hand stitched design. <br><br>

 Visitors of Shirdi used to visit the Kutir of Radhakrishna Mai to have the darshan of these pictures. Also Sai Baba used to send most of the visitors to the Kutir,
 asking them, did you visit the Shala? (School), which meant the kutir of Radhakrishna Mai.<br>

Radhakrishna Mai used to prepare morning breakfast for Sai Baba, other than that she did not have to worry about cooking. In the afternoon she would eat whatever Sai Baba used to send
her as prasad to eat. In the evening prominent devotees of Sai Baba like Bapusaheb Buti would bring their food and everybody used to partake the food brought by everyone.
 Thus Radhakrishna Mai spent most of her time in devotion, singing devotional songs with ektara (a single string musical instrument). The melody could be herd in the Dwarkamai. <br><br>

More details can be had from Shri.M.B.Rege’s letter dated 3rd September 1968 on Radhakrishna Mai written to one Mr.Sridhar and got published in Sai Sudha Magazine, Golden Jubilee Issue –
 June 1990, All India Sai Samaj. <br>

Shri M.B.Rege came to Shirdi for the first time in December 1910 consequent on a vision in which he saw his  Kula Devi Shanta Durga of Kareta (Goa) with Shri Maha Vishnu and his Master.
 In the dream, Shri Maha Vishnu said that the three were in fact one and that Shri Sai Baba would be his saviour. <br>

Shri.Rege narrates further details in his own words as below:<br>

In my first visit, the master asked me to go to mother Radhakrishna whom He described as His mother and mine. My association with her and I owe my spiritual life to her –
 left no doubt in my mind that she was the Yoga Maya like the Yogini, who gave Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa his training in ‘Tantra’. Mother Ramakrishna, whom the master always referred to as
 Ramakrishni, was to me an ideal of the Madhura Bhakti of the Gopis. All her belongings in the world were a durrie (cotton mat) a blanket, a pair of dhotis, Eknath Maharaja’s Bhagwat, abhangas
 of Sri Thukaram and a lota. She had an idol of Lord Krishna – she called it ‘Chahabi’ and occasional singing of Bhajans in which she would get unconscious in a deep trance. <br><br>

 Mother Radhakrishna was of ordinary build, about 5 feet high, but had an iron will and the strength of a giant. She used to fetch water from a well about a furlong away in large pots. <br>

 A gentleman from Mumbai took some snap shots of her without her knowledge; but some one spoke of it as the gentleman was leaving Shirdi in a tonga.
 She ran after the tonga for about a mile, wrested the camera and smashed it.<br>


In 1914, Guru Poornima. The food was used to be cooked in mother’s house, but she said that if I was not there, it had better be cooked
elsewhere. On the Guru Poornma day, she got an extra quota from Baba’s ‘Bhiksha’. She then announced that I was coming and the cooking started. I reached at about 9 a.m. They wanted a stone
 to pound the spices (masala). The step leading to the house was considered good and mother and I moved it with some difficulty. Just as it was in the door frame, a devotee Sri Purandare came
  up and wanted to help. The stone turned and it might have crushed my hand but the mother pulled it towards herself and the index finger of her right hand was crushed into two. You can imagine
   her agony; but as if nothing had happened, she soaked a rag in oil and wrapping the bleeding finger, went on to help in cooking. Only after all was over, she called me and said she was feeling
    the pain and would like to go to the jungle and cry. We went and for half an hour she did cry. Then we came back for our normal work. What control over the body and indifference to pleasure and
    pain in the service of the Master! <br><br>
<br>Cleaning Dwarakamai <br>
There are few devotees who served Baba by cleaning his Dwarakamai. There was a guy called Abdul who sweeps Dwarakamai and also lit lamps regularly. The most important of all charecter
 I admire is Radhakrishnamai. She cleans Dwarakamai with so much dedication. <br>

As you all know, Sai lives in Dwarakamai and Chawdi alternatively. So Radhakrishnamai cleans Dwarakamai. Dhuni – The sacred fire of Sai would have made the walls dark.
 Hence, She will even white wash it regularly as She desires to keep Sai’s Dwarakamai beautiful. I often remember Radhakrishamai for this seva She has done to Sai.

<br>Though Baba seemed outwardly to enjoy sense-objects, he had not the least flavour in them, nor even the consciousness of enjoying them. Though He ate, he had no taste and though He saw, He never felt any interest in what He saw. Regarding passion, He was as perfect a celibate as Hanuman. He was not attached to anything. He was pure consciousness, the resting place of desire, anger, and other feelings. In short, He was disinterested, free and perfect. A striking instance may be citied in illustration of this statement. <br>
 <br><strong>1886, April 16</strong> <br>

Mahasamadhi of Shri Ramkrishna Paramahansa of Bengal 1886, Margashirsh 15 Sai Baba got rid of an attack of asthma, by going into samadhi for 72 Hrs.
<br><strong>1887</strong> <br>

Manthrapragada Ramalaksmhi Devi, and my father, Venkata Narasimha Rao???who were childless in spite of efforts???visited their Guru, Shirdi Sai Baba, in 1887 and prayed to him for a child. As the fruit of Shirdi Sai Baba's grace, I was born to them on August 8, 1888. Shirdi Sai Baba himself gave me my name, Shringeri Sharada Devi. As I am of fair complexion, he used to lovingly call me Gori.
<br>
1889 <br>
Abdullah arrived at Shirdi from Nanded (in West Khandesh near Jalgaon and Amalner). <br>

A false Guru named Jowahar Ali from Ahmednagar came to Shirdi and told everyone that Sai Baba was his pupil ( shishya ) and took him along with him to Rahata, a nearby
 village. Without any protest, Baba followed Jowahar Ali and served him as his pupil for about six months. Even though several defects were found in the false Guru, Baba,
 without complaining served him sincerely, thus showing to the world how a pupil should behave towards his Guru. Afterwards, the villagers of Shirdi exposed the false Guru and
  brought Baba back to Shirdi. <br>

  Lord or Bhagwan is said to have six qualities, viz. (1) Fame, (2) Wealth, (3) Non-attachment, (4) Knowledge, (5) Grandeur, and (6) Generosity. Baba had all these in Him. He incarnated in flesh for the sake of the Bhaktas. Wonderful was His grace and kindness! He drew the devotees to Him, or how else one could have known Him! For the sake of His Bhaktas Baba spoke such words, as the Goddness of Speech dare not utter. Here is a specimen. Baba spoke very humbly as follows:- "Slave of slaves I am your debtor, I am satisfied at your darshan. It is a great favour that I saw your feet. I am an insect in your excreta. I consider Myself blessed thereby". What humility is this? If anybody would think that by publishing this, any disrespect is shown to Sai, we beg His pardon and to atone for this we sing and chant Baba's name.

<br> <br>
3 day Samadhi of Shirdi Sai
Baba: <br>
As described in Chapter 43 &
44 of Shri Sai Satcharita, Sai
Baba attained Maha Samadhi
and left His mortal coil on the
day of Dasara dated 15th
October 1918. Thirty-two years
before i.e. in 1886 Baba had
made an attempt to cross the
border line by attaining
Samadhi for three days. On a
Margashirsha Pournima (Full
moon) day, Baba suffered from
a severe attack of Asthma. To
get rid of it, Baba decided to
take His Pran high up and go
into Samadhi. He said to
Bhagat Mhalsapati, “Protect My
body for three days! If I return,
it will be all right, if I do not,
bury My body in that open land
(pointing to it ) and fix two
flags there as a mark !” After
saying this, Baba fell down at
about 10 p.m. His breathing
stopped as well as His pulse. It
seemed as if His Pran left the
body. All the people, including
the villagers came there and
wanted to hold an inquest and
bury the body in the place,
pointed by Baba. But,
Mhalsapati prevented this. With
Baba`s body on his lap, he sat
full three days guarding it.
After three days passed, Baba
showed signs of life at 3 a.m.,
His breathing commenced, the
abdomen began to move. His
eyes opened and stretching His
limbs, Baba returned to
consciousness (life) again <br><br>

THE SMALL SILVER PADUKAS IN FRONT OF DHUNI MAA <br>
<img src="{% static "images/dhuni8.png" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="230">
<br> These small silver Padukas are in the North West corner, and in front of the Dhuni Maa. It is the sacred place where Baba sat every morning before 5.00 AM for about an hour. This hour Baba spent in solitude. At that time other devotees were not allowed to approach Baba, except for the Sevkaries who quietly came and swept the Dwarakamai. Bhagoji Shinde was the first devotee to go to Baba and massage his burnt hand.
Saibaba Chavadi shirdi
<br>
<br>THE PUJA PILLAR <br>
Baba sat near the pillar, which is adjacent to the small Silver Padukas. Baba always sat straight and did not rest his back against the pillar. Baba was very fond of the pillar and asked many devotees to perform Puja to it. The details are as follows:
<br>
In the year 1908, Tatya Saheb Nulkar, who was a sub judge in Pandharpur came to stay in Shirdi. Baba asked him to stay in the Chavadi.
<br>
One day, in the morning Baba told Shama, “Ask Mhatara (old man) to perform Puja to the pillar”. Shama went and told Nulkar (Mhatara) exactly what Baba had said. Both of them discussed the reason for this, but could not come up with an answer. At last they consulted the almanac, and found that it was Vyas Purnima or Guru Purnima. But Baba had asked him to perform puja to the pillar, and not to him. Nonetheless they were happy that at least he had allowed puja to be performed in the Dwaraka Mai. Nulkar was performing puja to the pillar when Shama turned up. Baba said, “Why is he performing puja all by himself? Why can’t you too perform the puja?”. Shama replied “I will not perform puja to this pillar. But if you will allow me to perform pooja to you, I will gladly do so. I will only worship you and not this or any other pillar”. After a lot of debate and discussion, Baba finally agreed.
<br>
Dada Kelkar was aware that it was Guru Purnima, so he sent for Tatya who had gone to his farm. Both of them went with puja materials, and performed Guru Puja. The rest of the devotees present in Dwaraka Mai followed suite. They offered fruits, dakshina and vastra (dhotis) to their Guru. The dhoti was of no use to Baba but they got the opportunity to do Guru Puja that day and they hoped that it would continue in the future.
<br>
Thus the festival of Guru Purnima started, and now it is celebrated as a three day function by the Sansthan. On the first day there is Akhand Parayan, the second day is the main festival and it concludes on the third day with Gopal Kaala. Guru Purnima is celebrated in the Ashada Masa (June-July). The meaning of “Baba Sitting in Front of Dhuni Maa” There is also an original photograph of Baba sitting in front of Dhuni Maa taken during Baba’s period.
<br>
<img src="{% static "images/Shirdi_Sai_Baba_3.jpg" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="280"> <br><br>Baba Sitting in Front of Dhuni Maa
<br>
This pose possibly represents the “inward journey” that we have to take to reach “Baba”, and be one with him. This journey started with the first step of withdrawing our Karmendriyaas totally from this mundane life. This is represented by the left leg which is not seen.
<br>
Control the Jnanendriyaas, which are to act over the Karmendriyaas which is represented by the right leg over the left leg.
<br>
This is achieved by following the messages heard or insight derived from this inward journey. This is represented by the closed fist of the right hand which is kept next to the ear. An invisible Antakarna Chatushtaya with adhimanas as support is represented by the right hand kept next to the right ear.
<br>
The left hand over the right leg represents surrendering to him in totality. We have to surrender all of the following, the three Shariras, the trigunas, the arishadvargas, the 5 pranas, and the 5 koshas. This is achieved by following the Jnana Marga, Bhakti Marga, Karma Marga or the blend of these three.
<br>
<img src="{% static "images/dhuni7.png" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="230"> <br><br>THE KOLAMBA <br>
This Kolamba is an earthen container which was used by Baba to mix the food received by Bhiksha.
<br>
Baba used to take Biksha from five blessed houses daily. He called out "Oh. Lassie give me a piece of bread". He begged three to four times a day till noon, but His Biksha was erratic and irregular (Ref. ESS, Ch.VIII). This mixture known as Kala would then be distributed to numerous devotees, birds, cats and dogs and Baba did not drive them away. Baba himself ate very little of the remaining food. This practice of Biksha went on till His Mahasamadhi. If He could not go He deputed someone else like Vamanrao Patel or G.G. Narke.<br>

THE KOLAMBA <br>

The significance of the Kolamba lies in the fact that it is made of clay and thus may break at any time. Just as the human body is transient and death may strike at any moment the body also acts as a container to mix the various acts of life. These actions and their consequences are akin to the food got by begging from our own doings. The taste of the food may be sweet (happiness) or sour (sorrow). Baba by mixing the food is teaching us to receive the happenings in our lives with equanimity.
<br>
The food will taste sweet, sour or bitter as long as it is in contact with the tongue. Once it crosses the tongue no taste is experienced, as there are no separate compartments in the digestive system. For the digestive system different types of food are the same for it to conduct its function.
<br>
The tongue is the most important organ of our body. We do all kinds of deeds just to fill its needs not only for ourselves but for our generations to come. Everyone is busy trying to amass wealth, when we are not sure of our very own existence, thus becoming a slave to passions, thereby hiding the real “self”.
<br>
Baba is teaching us not to become a slave of the tongue. Having the tongue under our control, we can march towards the supreme.
<br>
The Pujari from Samadhi Mandir comes and offers Bhog to Baba twice a day, and leaves some Prasad in this Kolamba for the devotees to share. Various devotees offering Prasad to Baba offer it to Dhuni Maa and leave some in this Kolamba.
<br> <img src="{% static "images/dhuni6.png" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="230"> <br><br>THE MAATH OR WATER POT <br>
The Maath or Water Pot is an earthen pot in which Baba stored water. Baba himself used to carry water from the well behind the Samadhi Mandir and fill this pot. This Maath or Water Pot is placed on a stand made of coiled cloth next to the Kolamba adjacent to the southern wall of the Dwarakamai. The Maath or Water Pot kept in the Dwaraka Mai has been changed numerous times. However, the stand (coiled cloth) is in the museum. Devotees used the water as “Tirth” to get relief from their ailments. Now-a-days this pot is being filled by the Pujari of the Dwarakamai. <br>

THE MAATH OR WATER POT <br> <br>

THE MAGICAL CHILLIM (CLAY PIPE) <br>
The Magical Chillim was Baba’s constant companion during his sojourn on earth. Blessed was the potter who made them, and blessed was the clay that touched Baba’s hands and lips.
 <br>
On the right side of the Maath or Water Pot in the corner were a stack of Chillims’ that Baba had smoked. And next to them in another heap were new and unused Chillims. Till the year 1930, the Chillims were kept this way. Now, the unused new Chillims are kept in the Museum in Dixit Wada.

Chandbhai Patil was a truly blessed soul, who got the first taste of Baba’s Chillim. The bondage between them was great. Baba after smoking and sharing his Chillim actually went and stayed with Chandbhai. He was instrumental in brining Baba back to Shirdi, along with his marriage party.
THE MAGICAL CHILLIM (CLAY PIPE)
<br>
Baba bestowed his grace on many a devotee by allowing them to smoke his Chillim. The most amazing story is of Balaram Dhurandar (Shri Sai Satcharitra, Chapter 51). He was troubled by bouts of cough and had asthma for six years. On his visit to Shirdi he went to the Dwaraka Mai one afternoon, and with great humility started pressing Baba’s feet. Baba handed him his Chillim to smoke. Balaram accepted it as Prasad, and took a puff. The very thought of smoking was painful and alien to him. He had utmost faith in Baba, so he smoked a while and humbly returned the Chillim to Baba.
<br>
Lo! His asthma vanished and he was relieved of the tightness in his chest. He wasn’t tormented by breathlessness or coughing bouts thereafter. However, on the day that Baba took Mahasamadhi his asthma was triggered and he coughed all day. That day and only that day did he cough, and wasn’t bothered by it again. How could he ever forget the miracle of the clay pipe? Ganesh S Khaparde was a renowned, wealthy lawyer from Amaravati. He was a loyal aid of Lokamanya Tilak, who was serving a six-year sentence in Burma. Baba kept Khaparde in Shirdi and rescued him from the clutches of the British, who were waiting for a chance to prosecute him for treason and sedition.
<br>
Khaparde was a spiritual man, well versed in Sanskrit, the Shastras and the Puranas. Time and again during the Arati Baba made mystic signs and offered his Chillim, when he could unravel the answers. At times the Chillim calmed his restless mind and gave him reassurance. On 22nd January 1912 Khaparde writes, “During the course of worship he (Baba) put two flowers in his nostrils, and two others between his ears and head. I thought this was his instruction, and when I interpreted it in my mind, he offered his Chillim to me and thus confirmed it”.
<br>
Krishnaji Bhishma, the author of Sai Sagunopasana (Arati Book), was disgusted by the thought of devotees drinking Paad Tirth of a Muslim Sai Baba. He was horrified to see Brahmin devotees puff the Chillim after Baba had smoked it, and mentally he resolved not to do both. One day Baba narrated a story to him. It was the same dream vision that he had had earlier. While narrating the story Baba usually passed his Chillim to Bhishma. He took a puff and was thrown into bliss and ecstasy, and changed for life. At that moment, he became an ardent devotee.
<br>
Bhagoji Shinde and Mahalsapati smoked the Chillim with Baba every morning. Now the Chillim is offered to Baba’s photograph in the Chavadi during Adkar’s Arati Sai Baba Soukhya Datara Jeeva.
<br><img src="{% static "images/dhuni4.png" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="230"> <br><br>THE HOOKS ON THE CEILING <br>
These hooks are on the ceiling in front of the Nimbar. Nana Saheb Dengle brought a wooden plank of about 8” wide and 5' in length and gave it to Baba for sleeping. He thought that Baba could sleep on it instead of sleeping on the floor.
<br>
Baba however tied this plank with old rags to the hooks on the ceiling like a swing. After lighting four Panthis (earthen lamps), he placed them in each corner of the plank. Baba The Yogi Raj' then slept on this plank. One could see him either sitting there with his head bent, or sleeping on the plank. Many people wondered how he got up and down from this plank, and tried to watch this leela, but were not successful. Then one day Baba broke the plank. This leela is described in detail in the Shri Sai Satcharitra Chapter 10. <br>
THE HOOKS ON THE CEILING <br>

Dasganu says, "The plank hung so close to the ceiling that no one could sit upright. One could only sit on it bending one's body like an arch. Yet this great Yogi slept on it"! (Refer Bhakta Leelamrita, Chapter 31).
<br>
"Meditate always on My formless nature, which is knowledge incarnate, consciousness, and bliss. If you can not do this, meditate on My Form from top to toe, as you see here night and day " said Baba to Dhabolkar (Ref. ESS. Ch. XVII). Although Baba was surrounded by countless devotees, Shyama and Mahalsapathi being His constant companions, yet none of them saw Baba get up or get down the 'swing bed'.
<br>
"You thought, that I was in Shirdi, with a body composed of the five elements and 3 1/2 cubics in length, and not outside of it. Now you see and determine for yourself whether the person you see here now, is the same you saw at Shirdi” said Baba to Mankar at Machindragada (Satara district) (Ref. ESS, CH. XXXI).
<br>
"I require no door to enter, I have no form or any extension, I live everywhere, I carry on as the wirepuller, alter the actions of the men who trust Me and merge in Me" said Baba to Megha.
<br>
Baba is Parabrahma. One who is without birth, body, age and death. He was, is and will be with us eternally. When that being the case, how could they see Him in the “Anima or the formless state?”
<br>
Devotees who visit Dwaraka Mai today look with wonderment at the ceiling in front of the "Nimbar" at these hooks.
<br><br>THE NIMBAR OR ALLAH MIA CHE JAGHA <br>
Upon ascending the central steps (3 steps) of the Dwarakamai Sanctum Sanctorum, the Nimbar is directly in front. The Nimbar or Allah Mia Che Jagha (the place of Allah Mia) is the arched structure in the wall. It is in the western wall of the Dwarakamai next to the ever burning lamps. It is garlanded daily, and often is venerated with a shawl.
<br>
In a Masjid the Nimbar is said to represent the Darga of Mecca. The devout Muslims do Namaz in front of it. Mention is made of this Nimbar in several places in the Shri Sai Satcharitra. The Urs started in 1897 and during that yatra (fair), the “Sandal Procession” also took place. This procession is held in honor of great Muslim saints. Chandan paste and scrapings are put in a Thali and carried around the village in procession. After returning to the Masjid the chandan is pasted with the hands on this Nimbar. This Sandal procession was started by Amir Shakkar Dalal of Korhla. Now the descendants of Abdul Baba carry on this tradition. (Refer Shri Sai Satchritra Chapter 6).
 <br>
<img src="{% static "images/dhuni3.png" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="230"> <br><br>THE NIMBAR OR ALLAH MIA CHE JAGHA
<br>
After the Noon Arati the devotees went home. Baba then went inside, and sat behind the curtain, with His back to this Nimbar for his meal. There were two rows of devotees one on each side. After all the Naivedya was mixed together (kaala) and placed before Baba, he consecrated it and offered it to god and everybody dined to their hearts' content. (Refer Shri Sai Satcharitra Chapter 38).
<br><br>THE EVER BURNING LAMPS <br>
Baba was very fond of lighted Divas (earthen lamps). From the beginning of his stay in the Dwarakamai, Baba lit divas daily. And they burned perpetually. Baba celebrated Diwali with numerous lamps. He tore thin strips of cloth and twisted them and used them as wicks. Often he tore his old Kafni into thin strips and used it as wicks.
<br>
In Shri Sai Satcharitra Chapter 5, the leela of his lighting the lamps with water is given. One day the grocers refused to give him oil. Unperturbed He returned to the Dwarakamai. He took the empty tumbler that had a smidgen of oil in it. He filled it with water and drank it. Consecrated water and a few drops of oil and offered it to God, and then lit the lamps. Lo! They burned throughout the night.
<br>
The Jyoth has been burning perpetually since then. When the brass lamps are cleaned the wicks are temporarily placed in another lamp. The oil dripping from these lamps have healing properties. Numerous devotees have used it for Arthritis, Migraine, and other ailments with wonderful results.
<br><img src="{% static "images/dhuni2.png" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="230"> <br><br>THE JAATH OR QUERN (HAND MILL) <br>
In the Shri Sai Satchritra, Chapter 1 the wonderful leela of Baba grinding the wheat is described. During the year 1910, One day in the early morning, Baba sat down at the Quern to grind wheat. Four village women saw this; they took the peg of the quern from his hand and started grinding the wheat. While doing this they thought “Baba has no kith or kin and subsists on Bhiksha. So he will give us the flour”. After all the wheat was ground, they divided the wheat into four portions for themselves. Baba then used very foul and abusive language. He said, “Phukat Khau Randa” (free looting prostitute) and told them to take the flour and throw it on the village boundary. At that time, Cholera was raging through out the village. Seven people had already succumbed to the epidemic. This was Baba’s remedy to stop the epidemic. Since then, Cholera has not occurred in Shirdi, although neighboring villages are often afflicted. What was the relationship between Cholera and wheat flour?
<br>THE JAATH OR QUERN (HAND MILL) <br>

Cholera is called Mahamaari or the great killer. Mahamaari means sure death every time it strikes. There is no greater fear than the fear of death. Birth is followed by death at sometime for sure. One who has conquered the fear of death is immortal. So if one wants to conquer the cycle of birth and death, then one has to be liberated and free.
<br>
If the ultimate goal is liberation then why is one bound? The fact is that human beings are bound by Karma (actions) and Maya. In fact karma and maya are inseparably interlinked. They are the two facets of life.
The significance of Quern or Hand Mill <br>
Baba lived in Shirdi for 60 years and he ground the mental, physical afflictions and the miseries of innumerable devotees. In the Quern, lower stone represents Karma and upper stone represents Bhakti, and the handle of the Quern represents Jnana (knowledge) or self realization.
<br>
Self realization is not possible unless there is the prior act of grinding of all our impulses, desires, sins, trigunas and ego. Besides the philosophical significance and grinding the cholera germs Baba daily ground sins, mental and physical afflictions and miseries of his innumerable devotees and he is still continuing to do so.
<br>
Once Kabir saw a woman grinding corn and said, “I am weeping because I feel the agony of being crushed in this wheel of worldly existence, like the corn”. His guru Nipathiranjana reassured him saying, “Do not be afraid, but hold tightly the handle of knowledge of the hand mill, and do not wander far away. Turn inward to the centre and you are sure to be saved”. (Refer Shri Sai Satcharitra, Chapter 1)
<br>
Devotees can see this hand mill in the Dwarakamai entreating Baba to grind their sins. Another hand mill which Baba used for cooking is kept in the Museum.
<br><img src="{% static "images/dhuni1.png" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="280"> <br><br>THE SACK OF WHEAT <br>
During Baba’s sojourn in Shirdi, this sack of wheat was kept resting against the wall of the Dwarakamai. Now this sack of wheat is kept in a glass small cupboard, with a glass door next to the hand mill. Balaji Patil Nevaskar rendered selfless seva to Baba, by sweeping and cleaning the streets daily that Baba trod on.
<br>THE SACK OF WHEAT
<br>
Every year when there was a harvest in his field he would bring the whole quantity of wheat to Baba and maintain his family on whatever Baba gave him. Whether the amount of wheat was large or small did not matter to him as he believed that it belonged to Baba. Baba used to eat Chapattis made out of this wheat. (Refer Shri Sai Satcharitra, Chapter 35). This practice continued till he died. After him, his son also continued the same tradition. The wheat bag used to be replaced on every Ramanavami day by his family. Now the Sansthan has continued the tradition and will replace the old wheat bag with the new one. The old wheat bag is sent to Saibaba Prasadalaya.

THE PORTRAIT OF SAIBABA IN FRONT OF DHUNI MAA (DWARAKAMAI POSE) <br>
<img src="{% static "images/Shirdi_Sai_Baba_3.jpg" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="230"> <br>
This portrait is an oil painting by the famous artist Shyamrao Ramachandra Jaikar. Moreshwar Pradhan had brought Jaikar to Shirdi and requested him to make two portraits of Baba. After Jaikar met Baba, he on his own accord made more than two paintings, at Baba's bidding, when Baba said "Aur Banao Jyada Banao, main guttigulli mein rahnewalla hoon".
<br>THE PORTRAIT OF SAIBABA IN FRONT OF DHUNI MAA (DWARAKAMAI POSE) <br>

This portrait was presented to the Sansthan after Baba’s Mahasamadhi. It was installed in the very place where Baba sat. As the portrait was created with Baba’s consent it has this incredible feature that when a devotee looks at it with love and devotion, he gets the “living experience” of Baba in it.
<br>
Many a devotee has had unimaginable, and innumerable Leelas from this painting.
<br>
The devotees could not leave Shirdi without Baba's permission. When they wanted to leave they came to Baba in the Dwarakamai and sought his permission. Baba gave them Udi and his blessings and they had a safe journey. Even today devotees go to this portrait, prostrate asking for His permission and then take the Udi and leave thus having a successful and safe journey.
<br>
At present, the original painting done by Shyamrao Ramachandra Jaikar is kept in the Museum. The one that is seen now in Dwarakamai is a copy of the original painting.
<br>
This famous and beautiful portrait is a masterpiece and is widely known as “The Dwarakamai Baba Pose”.
<br>
Every night the priest places a Kalasha filled with water, and a kerosene oil lantern that is lit. The portrait is covered with a mosquito net. It is believed that when a human being sleeps the atman leaves the body and travels about here and there. Finally, it comes back to the body; water is binding force that helps it to identify the proper body. The light from the lantern does the same.
The Possible Meaning of the Dwarakamai Pose <br>
Baba is sitting next to the railing, and his silhouette is in the form of a triangle with the apex at his head with the Bilva leaf on it. It signifies Mount Meru the above of mother Parvati. So he is the mother calling his children (us) to come and take refuge in him. The Kakad Arati says, “Tu Shanti Kshamecha Meru Ho. Tu Bhavarnaviche Taaru Guruvara (You are the mountain Meru of peace and forgiveness. You are the bark that ferries us across this mundane existence)”.
<br>
By this posture Baba is instructing us to totally surrender at his lotus feet. This is done by offering the Pancha Pranas, Arishadvargas, Trigunas, Karmendriyas and Jnanendriyas represented by the five fingers of the left hand. Manas, Budhi and Chitta are represented by the three fingers of the right hand that are not visible. The index finger is pointing down representing Aham (Pride and Ego). The thumb represents the Sadguru or Parabrahma which is turned in pointing to himself. It is the Sadguru or Parabrahma who can cleanse the Jeevatma of all impurities and undesirable traits.
<br>
This is total surrender to his lotus feet. He is not only assuring us but also promising us (represented by his firmly placed right foot) that he will take us on his lap, represented by his left foot. Thus, this pose is an assurance that he is prepared to take us on his lap like a mother, provided we surrender to him in toto.
THE SILVER COVERED PADUKAS IN FRONT OF BABA'S PORTRAIT <br>
In front of the portrait painted by Shyamrao Ramachandra Jaikar, is a pair of silver covered Padukas. They were mounted in a granite platform about 3” above the floor. After Baba's Mahasamadhi, Shama was staying in the Dixit Wada. The Sansthan was formed and Shama was asked to pay rent. Shama however, left Dixit Wada and took along with him Baba's Padukas and Photograph to his house. The Sansthan requested Shama to return them but he refused at first. Then S.B. Dhumal went to his house with a big procession and Shama handed over all the articles. <br><br>
THE SILVER COVERED PADUKAS IN FRONT OF BABA'S PORTRAIT <br>

These Padukas are worshipped daily in the morning by the Pujari of the Dwarakamai and decorated with ashtagandh. The Pujari of Samadhi Mandir between comes to the Dwarakamai between 11.30 and 12.00 noon to perform Vaishva Deva Puja. He cleans Baba’s photograph and the padukas and applies fresh ashtagandh. Now these padukas are installed on a pedestal about 3’ high and are covered with gold foil. Devotees offer their “Sashtang Namaskar” to these holy Padukas.
THE KATHADA (RAILING) ON WHICH BABA RESTED HIS HAND <br>
This is the railing on which Baba rested his left hand. Baba sat near the wall of the Masjid facing south (towards Dhuni) but he did not lean against it. He always sat upright.
 <br>
In the north east corner Baba sat in the direction of Ishaanya. His leg outstretched, showing his blessings on the devotees. There are eight directions or quarters in this world, each, presided and protected by a deity or Dikpalaka. Baba sat in the north east corner which is protected by Ishaana whose vehicle is an Ox. This symbolizes that each individual goes a certain direction, or follows a certain path that makes or mars his life, according to his vasans. It is lord Ishaana who guides the world. He will come riding on the Ox or Vrishabha to exhaust the accumulated vasanas of the jeevas. Thus, Baba sitting in the North East direction guides the individual in the right direction. Therefore, any Puja starts with Ashta Digbhandana (the Eight Direction Bondage). Then the mind of the individual is arrested from taking any particular direction and he discovers his own true nature.
<br><br>THE KATHADA (RAILING) ON WHICH BABA RESTED HIS HAND <br>

Baba sat facing the south; he is Dakshinamoorthy. The south is the special domain of lord Yama. Yama means control; it can be self-control, as well as a limitation over ones’ capacity. The ever smiling, Guru, Saibaba symbolizes the fact that a man of realization has transcended time. That the Guru’s grace is being showered on the devotees who are caught in the net of Yama, the lord of death. The Guru leads the disciple to immortality.
<br>
This railing has been painted over and over again but if one lovingly rests one's forehead on the railing, one can feel a gentle depression where Baba probably rested His hand. Recently the Sansthan have placed a plastic cover over the whole railing.
Baba’s Asana <br>
Dixit was concerned about Baba sitting on the cold floor. It got so cold in winter that it was impossible to stand on the tiles that he had laid. Baba sat on the floor for hours together. As Baba would not accept a cotton mattress, immediately he set out and made a mattress of sack cloth. This Baba did not object to. That evening after his rounds, Baba asked them to remove the mattress. So every evening Dixit would take the mattress to his Wada, and return with it early next morning. So the sack mattress became Baba’s Asana.
<br>
Baba usually sat on a piece of sack cloth but His bhaktas lovingly placed a Gaadi over it and bolsters for Him to rest. Baba usually sat with His legs outstretched and His left hand rested on this railing. (Refer Sai Leela Magazine, Margashirsha Shake 1857 year 12 (1936)).
<br><br>THE UDI STAND <br> <hr>
<p style="color:white;">
The Kathada (railing) is attached to a pillar and to this pillar the Udi stand or container was fixed. Udi, the sacred ash that came from Baba’s Dhuni Maa was plentiful and Baba gave a palm full of Udi to his devotees. This Udi is called as “Angara, Rakh, Bhasma or Vibhuti”. It is the gift of Dhuni Maa. That wonderful Dhuni Maa that Baba lit when he came to stay in the Dwarakamai.
<br>
The meaning of Udi is detachment based on discriminating knowledge. The literal meaning of Udi is 'to go'. Baba gave Udi to His devotees with blessings that they should go to a higher plane in their spiritual endeavor.
<br>
When Baba was in a cheerful mood he used to sing in a melodious voice merrily about the sacred Udi “Shri Rama has come. He has come during his wanderings. And he has brought bags full of Udi”. The Akhand Dhuni Maa is yielding abundant Udi even now and will continue to do so till the end of time. (Refer Shri Sai Satcharitra, Chapter 33).
<br>THE UDI STAND
<br>
During the early days of his stay in Shirdi, Baba gave medicines to the sick people without accepting any payment from anybody. But after few years, he stopped dispensing medicines and started giving Udi instead.
<br>
Baba used to give Udi to the devotees after the Arati and also at the time of departure.
<br>
Udi has healing powers, during Baba's time it was used for scorpion sting, bubonic plague and the 'Jamner miracle,' just to mention a few. The power of the Udi is as potent as before, and is still curing the diseases and Karmic impediments. In the Shri Sai Satcharitra, Chapter 33 and 44, the leelas and greatness of the Udi is given beautifully.
<br>
Baba went into the forests around Shirdi and brought wood for the Dhuni Maa. Sometimes he went to forests far away, and brought huge logs of wood. This he did himself; there was always a stack of logs near the Dwarakamai. These logs he fed to his Dhuni, and the ash or Udi he applied to devotee’s forehead. Vibhuti means “all pervading” or omnipresent. Baba had a unique way of applying Udi. He often took the Udi between his thumb and forefinger and applied it exactly in the centre between the eyebrows. This spot is the Trikuti or the third eye. It is the house of Brahman. Brahman enables you to get self-realization or realize the true self. This spot is also where the Ajna Chakra is seated, when the kundalini is awakened. Baba pressed his thumb laden with Udi on this Ajna Chakra and then drew his thumb in an upward direction. Baba also used to refer to this spot as the 17th Kala.
<br>
In the Prashna Upanishad of Atharva Veda, 6th Chapter, a mention has been made about 16 attributes of a person known as “Shodasha Kala”. Though a Purusha is made up of 16 attributes he is perpetually searching for the truth and wants to realize the atman. He cannot achieve it as he is submerged in Maya. Only the Sadguru with his grace can show him the right path.
<br>
Baba by applying Bhasma or Udi on the Ajna Chakra, the centre of the principle of the mind, makes the Purusha understand that he is drowned in maya. And that this transient world will one day be reduced to ashes. Thus Baba is instructing us to treat Bhasma as a path leading to Vibhuti or the all pervading (Parabrahma). This can be accomplished through Dharana, i.e., fixing the mind on him; Dhyana (meditating on him) which results in Samadhi (super conscious experience).
<br>
In order to get released from the bondage of Maya, develop Samyama or control of the mind by applying Udi.
<br>
The word Bhasma means sacred ash, representing the transient nature of the universe. One day, all existing things will burn to ashes. The wise do not develop any attachment to them. The use of Bhasma on the body ought to remind us of the transient nature of the world, so we should contemplate on the permanent or the Parabrahma.
<br>
Devotees may apply this Udi daily and take it as Tirth which will eradicate their Karma, diseases, fulfill their wishes and help them in their spiritual path.
<br><br>BABA'S BATHING STONE <br>
This stone was prepared by Rambaji of Nasik. Hearing of Baba's Leelas he came to Shirdi in a mentally disordered condition. He used to drink Baba's bath water and used it on his body. By doing so he got rid of his mental disorder. As a reminiscence of this he gratefully prepared this stone and offered it to Baba to sit and have bath on it.
<br>BABA'S BATHING STONE <br> <hr>
<p style="color:white;">

This bathing stone was kept in the verandah of the Dwaraka Mai. After the Museum was opened the bathing stone been housed in the hall on the ground floor of the Museum.
THE THREE STEPS NEXT TO THE OTA OR PLATFORM <br>
The three steps of Dwarakamai lead into the Sanctum Sanctorum. These 3 steps are now used to exit the Sanctum Sanctorum. Whenever Baba went for Bhiksha rounds or to Lendi Bagh and returned, he washed his feet and hands known as Upa Snan on these steps. Many devotees waited for this ritual to complete so that they could collect the water that flowed from his feet as Paada Teertha. This they drank and took home and distributed, for they knew that it would cure many physical and mental afflictions.
THE OTA OR PLATFORM WITH THE AGARBATTI STAND <br>
There is an Agarbatti (incense stick) stand attached to the platform. This platform is on the right side of the main entrance of the Dwarakamai. It is about 8’ long and 3-1/2 ‘ wide and has a height of 2-1/2’. The devotees would offer incense sticks to Baba. Then light them and fix them on this stand.
THE OTA OR PLATFORM WITH THE AGARBATTI STAND <br>

Baba often sat on this platform and distributed Udi after the Noon Arati. There is an original photograph of him sitting on this platform.
 <br><br>THE PALKI ROOM <br>
This room is on the right side of the main entrance of Dwarakamai. Due to the efforts of Radhakrishna Mai, Shirdi was turned into a Sansthan. In 1912 a Palki, Rath, many silver utensils and pots were presented. Once this Palki was left outside and some of the silver ornaments were stolen. The distraught devotees ran to Baba and complained and Baba simply said "Why did the thieves not take away the whole Palki?". So Purandhare and Radhakrishna Aai decided to make a room for it. Purandhare dared to put up the rafters after making five to six holes in the wall of Dwarakamai for support and the Palki was kept there. This Palki was presented by Sadu Bhayya Nayak of Harda.

Baba never sat in the Palki, but his photo was placed on it. Every Thursday at 9.15 PM the Palki is brought in procession to Chavadi.
THE TORTOISE
This marble tortoise is in the center of the well. The black tiles surrounding it represent the four flights of steps leading to the bottom of the well. Numerous meanings are attached to this tortoise. (1) The tortoise is an 'avatar' of Vishnu (Kurma Avatar) (2) That one should enter the place of worship like the tortoise bowing one's head, in complete surrender. Leaving the ego outside just as the tortoise in a prostrate position; one should surrender everything to Baba; (3) But most importantly the tortoise is looking at Baba and if we follow her example and look towards Baba he will surely look after us (Eleven sayings of Baba).
  <br>
<img src="{% static "images/pose.png" %}" alt="maha" width="230" height="230"> <br>
THE TORTOISE <br>

In Chapter 19 of Shri Sai Satcharitra Baba gives the analogy of the tortoise and says "Just as the mother tortoise feeds her young ones by her loving glances so was the way of my Guru. The mother tortoise is on this bank and her little ones are on the other bank. They are nurtured and reared just by her loving glances”.
 <br>
This tortoise is worshipped with “asthagandh” before “Kakad Aarti” and after 11.30 AM before “Noon Arati”.
<br>
The Repair of the Masjid <br>
Nana Sahib’s heart was bursting with love and devotion. He was eager to renovate and repair the old and dilapidated Masjid. His only thought was “How will I get permission to make the Masjid more habitable?”. Baba However was quite content, and did not grant him permission. Nonetheless with this thought in his mind he went to Shirdi.
<br>
The next morning Nana was standing outside the Masjid and waiting for Mahalsapati, who had done to get his Bhiksha. Having received it, he was about to enter the Masjid, when Nana accosted him. Nana was eager to tell him of his plan. At that very moment Baba called out to Mahalsapati.
<br>
Mahalsapti immediately went to Baba, who said, “Arre Bhagat, who is standing outside?”. Mahalsapti told him that it was Nana Sahib Chandorkar. Innocently Baba said, “Is that so? Bhagat I wanted to have your opinion on this matter. That Nana says, “Baba I would like to build a new Masjid”. Now don’t you think our old Masjid is good enough for us?”. To this Mahalsapati replied, “Baba let him build a new Masjid. It will be very useful for both of us, as we will have a place to sit, and to sleep when the time comes”. Then Baba agreed and gave his consent.
<br>
As soon as Baba gave his consent, Mahalsapati called out to Nana, and asked him to start the work. Nana immediately brought a coconut and broke it. Thus, on Mahalsapati’s advice Nana Sahib Chandorkar was allowed to renovate the Masjid. And Kaka Saheb Dixit was allowed to do the flooring. (Refer “Shiladhi” by Dr.Keshav B Gavankar).
<br>
The three carpenter brothers Kondaji, Gabaji and Tukaram Sutar provided the greatest help in the repair of Masjid. All the woodwork was done by them. After the renovation the management of the Masjid continued with them for many years. Till Baba’s Mahasamadhi, Tukaram undertook the sweeping of the Masjid. He took care of Baba’s needs like heating water, and giving it to Baba to wash his face and mouth. Baba would not allow any other person to do this. (Refer “Shri Sai Baba of Shirdi” by the Late Rao Bahadur M.W.Pradhan).<br> <br>
The Sabhamandap (1911) – Extension of Dwarakamai <br>
The area in front of the Dwaraka Mai was a vacant plot. The devotees stood there and attended the Aratis, often in the scorching heat and rain. Dixit thought that if a Sabhamandap or portico was built, then it would provide shelter for the devotees from the elements. He was determined to build it no matter what it cost.
 <br>
Gopal Gund who started the Urs thought that he should repair the Masjid. But that job was for Nana Chandorkar, and the pavement work for Dixit. Permission at first was not granted, but, on the intervention of Mahalsapathi, it was granted. Dixit wanted to extend the space in front of the Masjid so that the devotees could use it. He bought tall iron pillars, and angled brackets. On the day that Baba slept in the Chavadi, he and the other devotees worked all night. The next morning when Baba came to the Dwarakamai Mai he swiftly pulled out the pillars. In 1911 this Sabha Mandap was put in order with great efforts. In Sai Satcharitra, Chapter 6, a detailed account is given under “the renovation of the Masjid and construction of the Sabha Mandap”.
<br>
An incident is mentioned, how Baba caught hold of one post with one hand and Tatya's neck with the other hand and shook both. Then taking Tatya's pheta He burnt it offering one rupee from His pocket. Seeing this strange behaviour none dared to intervene. After cooling down He brought one beautiful embroidered pheta and Himself tied it on Tatya's head. As if Tatya was being given a special honour. (Ref. ESS, Ch.VI).
<br>
After this incident Baba allowed the work to go on smoothly and thus the devotees had a place for worshipping Baba. The pavilion is still there where the devotees can see, and participate in the worship of Baba and also touch the sacred articles used by Baba.
<br>
Thanks to Dixit’s dedication and determination. The devotees now can enjoy its comfort. In this Mandap many Palkis stop for a while. Devotees use it for exchanging garlands on their weddings, for christening ceremonies and Anna Prashana (the ceremony of solid food being given to the child). But most importantly, devotees recite the Vishnu Sahasranama, Do Baba’s Naam Jap, and read the Sai Satcharitra.
<br>
Thus, the Dwarakamai Mai had two parts, the Sanctum Sanctorum which is the Masjid or Dwarakamai Mai and the Sabha Mandap.
<br>
The Sanctum Sanctorum or Dwarakamai Mai faces east. Three steps lead to the inside. The three steps are 17’ in length and 15’ in breadth.
<br>
The entrance to the Sabha Mandap faces south. The roof has CI corrugated tin sheets. These sheets were donated by Baba’s ardent devotee Capt.Darruwala as a gesture of gratitude. Through his mysterious ways Baba saved him, his crew and some ships from the enemy during the Russo-Japanese war of 1905. The roof is supported by 12 iron pillars, 15’ long.
<br>
There are small niches in the eastern wall, seven on the right, and ten on the left, of the shrine that houses Baba’s photograph. In the past, devotees used to place lighted Diyas (earthen lamps) as Baba loved to light Diyas. The length of the Sabha Mandap is about 48’ from the Platform to the Shrine, and the breadth is 38’.
<br>
There is a room that shares its eastern wall of the Sabha Mandap. Its door faces east. The signboard above it reads, “Shyam Sunder Hall”.
<br>  <br>Dwarakamai in the 1920s <br>
Each and every article present in the Dwarakamai fills the devotee’s heart with love, joy and peace. Baba spent 60 years here. His touch has filled every stone, brick and woodwork with life. This is the place where he fondly asked about each devotee’s welfare, and told stories. Like a fond mother he fed the devotees sweets. Sometimes he cut fruits into small pieces and put small morsels into their mouth.
<br> shirdi sai baba Dwarakamyi Entrance <br>
rare photo of sree Dwarakamai <br>
In the place that he sat there was a hug portrait painted by Shamrao R Jaykar that faces the south. Now a copy of that portrait is there, and the original portrait is kept on the first floor of the Museum inside temple complex. This masterpiece is so much famous that it’s often referred to as the Dwarakamai Mai Baba Photograph. Below this portrait was a Chappi (a wet cloth that is wound around the end of the Chillim) and a Chillim. A set of marble Padukas were installed directly in front of the portrait for the devotees to Namaskar. The Nimbar was garlanded daily and draped with a beautiful shawl. Next to it were the three ever burning lamps. The lamps are still there. There were two Grinding Mills next to the lamps. Baba used the Bigger Grinding Mill when he ground wheat to drive away the cholera epidemic that had spread widely in Shirdi village. He used the smaller one to grind pulses, and spices when he wanted to do Annadaan. Beside the lamps was, and still is, a sack filled with wheat.
<br>

To the left, in the alcove was the clay Maath (water pot). In the corner near the math were a stack of Chillims that are now in the museum. Next to these were Baba’s Bhiksha utensils, like the Tumrel and Kolamba. The Tumrels are now kept in the museum. In front was the open Dhuni Mai. Then a small wall was erected around it and the Dhuni Mai was enclosed. In a cupboard next to the Dhuni Mai heaps of Baba’s Kafnis were neatly folded and stored. Now, Baba’s Kafni is hung in the museum. (Refer “Shiladhi” by Dr.Keshav B Gavankar).
<br>
At present the cupboard is used to store Baba’s Alankar items like Chandan, Ashtagandh and Kumkum. In the cupboard on the left, the articles that he needs for the night are stored. These articles are the Mosquito Net, the Copper Kalasha for water, and a Phool Patra (this is a flat bottomed, copper tumbler that is kept over the mouth of the Kalasha) and the Kerosene Oil Lantern.
<br>
In 1959 the Shirdi Saibaba Sansthan made some more renovations. In 1998 the Sansthan redid the Dhuni Mai, and laid heat resistant bricks at the base. They also made a Chimney. While this work was going on for a few days, the Jyot (Fire) was maintained in a small, temporary Dhuni Mai.
<br>
The door number of Dwarakamai Masjid allotted by Shirdi Municipal Corporation is 778. This can be seen on the left side of the wall present next to the main entrance of Dwarakamai.
<br> <br>
Premonition of burning fields  :-<br> Once, harvesting in Shirdi had been completed and the foodgrains of the entire village had been stored in a yard. The summer was on. The heat was intense as only those who have lived in Shirdi know. One afternoon Sai Baba summoned Kondaji Sutar and said to him: "Go, your field is on flrel" Frightened, Kondaji ran to his field and. frantically looked around for any sign of fire. There wasn't any. He returned to the masjid and informed Sai Baba that he had looked everywhere but had found no trace of fire and why did Baba have to frighten him? Unfazed, Baba said : "You better turn back and look again." Baba was right after all. Kondaji noticed that a sheaf of corn was indeed on fire and smoke was billowing from it. A strong wind was fanning the fire and word had gone round to the villagers who now came running to the scene. "Sai Baba," the people shouted "help us, help us put the fire out!" Thereupon, Sai Baba walked casually towards the yard, sprinkled some water on a stack of sheaves and said: " There now! The fire will die down!" And so it happened.
<br><br>
Stopping the rain :- <br>
<img src="{% static "images/babawaterfire.jpg" %}" alt="maha" width="330" height="230"> <br>There is the story of one Rao Bahadur Moreshwar Fradhan who had come to Shirdi to take Sai Baba's darshan along with his wife. As the couple were about to leave, it began to rain heavily. Thunder and lightning rent the air. As the Pradhan couple looked round in dismay, Sai Baba prayed. "Oh Allah!" he intoned, "let the rains cease. My children are going home. Let them go peacefully!" The storm thereupon ceased, the downpour reduced to slight drizzle and the Pradhans were able to reach their destination safely.<br>
<br>There was  another occasion when many thought that the masjid which housed Sai Baba, itself would be consumed by fire from the flames which leapt up from the dhuni. All that Baba did was to take some swipes at a wooden pillar in front of him. With every blow the flames subsided and the fire died down. "Miraculous," said his devotees. Often they would notice him stirring some hot concotion over the kitchen fire, not with a ladle but with his bare hands. There never was a time when his hand was scalded. What supernatural powers did he have? On yet another occasion, Sai Baba was partaking of food with three of his devotees in the masjid when, without any cause for provocation, he exclaimed- "Stop!" Then, as if nothing had happened, the four continued with their meal. Lunch over and the dishes cleared, they stepped out of the masjid, when large chunks of the ceiling fell on the very spot where they had been seated only a few minutes earlier. Did Sai Baba's powers extend even to inanimate matter, the devotees wondered. Instances have been quoted by his devotees as to how Sai Baba commanded the rains to stop and the winds to cease.
<br>Raising the water level in well :-<br>
<br>When Sai Baba first came to Shirdi it had of no basic facilities. There was a well put only in name. It had no natural spring water and if ever there had been one, it must long ago have dried up. Water had to be fetched from a distance. When, therefore, Sai Baba gave his permission to the villagers to celebrate the Ram Navami Fair, (Baba's Birthday) the big problem facing the organizers was one of water supply. So What should they do but go to Sai Baba with their problem? "'Oh yes," said Sai Baba, 'so you want plenty of water, do you? Here, take this and drop it in the well and wait and see." "'This," turned up to be a platter of flowers on which some prasad (blessed food) had been placed along with the remnants of alms Baba had received earlier in the day. The villagers had no qualms about doing as they were told. Their faith in Sai Baba was total. No sooner had that platter of leaves been dropped in the well, it is said, water rose from the bottom as if by divine command and completely filled it. And great was the rejoicing of the people.
<br><br>
Saving a child from drowning :<br>One report has it that word had spread that the 3-year old daughter of a poor man called Babu
Kirwandikar had fallen into the well and had been drowned. When the villagers rushed to the well they saw the child suspended
 in mid-air as if some invisible hand was holding her up! She was quickly pulled out. Sai Baba was fond of that child who was often
  heard to say : I am Baba's sister!" After this incident, the villagers took her at her word. "it is all Baba's Leela", the people
   would say philosophically. They could offer no other explanation.
<br><br>
Flow of Godavari (river) from Baba's feet :-
<br>These were instances of things they had seen with their own eyes. It was not secondhand information they had gathered. Sai Baba was to them as real as their homes and their fields and their cattle and the distant hills. Das Ganu once had an unforgettable experience. On a festive occasion, he sought Baba's permission to go to a place called Singba on the banks of the Godavari to have a bath in the holy waters. "No," Baba replied resolutely, "where is the need to go all the way when the Godavari is here right at my feet?" Das Ganu was vexed. He was willing to concede that Ganga the holy river (Baba frequently referred to Godavari as Ganga) rose from the feet of Sri Narayana (one among the Hindu trinity of Gods) himself, but his faith was not deep enough to believe that the waters of the Godavari could spring form the feet of his master, Sri Sai Baba who was reading Das Ganu's mind decided that this was the time to strengthen Das Ganu's faith. He told his devotee: "come closer to me and hold the hollow of your palms at my feet!". As soon as he did so water flowed freely out of the toes of the master's feet and filled the hollow of Das Ganu's palms in no time. His joy knew no limits. He sprinkled the water on his head and his body and distributed some more among the assembled devotees as tirtha (holy water).

<p style="color:white;">
Sai Baba during his last time used to listen devotee voice who was reading sacred book of religion and he express the inner sense of these lines . This went on daily in the mornings and evenings. It was the practice to read sacred books before a person who would die soon.
Sai Baba Shirdi Maha Samadhi On 8 October 1918, Sai Baba became very weak. He sat leaning on the wall of the mosque. Aarties and worship were done as usual. The devotees were not allowed to go near him and this was ensured by Shama and Nana Chandorkar. Some people with a tiger in the cart were going round places and earning money. They came to Shirdi and brought the tiger near to Dwarakamai . The tiger was suffering from some disease and was weak. On seeing Baba, the tiger was saluting Baba. Baba looked into the eyes of the tiger deeply . The tiger also looked at Baba and shed tears. Seeing Baba thus it breathed its last. Thus Baba helped the tiger to merge with God.
<br><br>
Last Days <br>
Baba Sai became weaken day by day , he gave necessary directions to the devotees. He never did anything for himself. His life aim was to provide peace and happiness to all mankind. Baba as usual went out for alms to five houses and after collecting the food, put some in the Dhuni and fed the animals and birds with the remaining food.
Baba s body looked very weak. The eyes which were shining like fire, were sunken. Even then there was no change in his concentrated looks. He gave proper advice and udi prasad to the devotees who came to him. Devotee wished to recovery of sai baba . On the night of 14 October, even though he was seriously ill, he got up and made loud noise and hit the floor with his sataka. Everyone woke up at the sound. Then Baba explained his action by saying that thieves had come to Khaparde s house at Amaravathi and he drove them away. In his last hours also, Baba was thinking about his devotees only and not about himself.
<br><br>
Final Day <br>
The day was Tuesday, the 15th of October, 1918. Last day of baba physical body .It was Vijayadashami (Dushera) . Baba became bodily very weak, Baba got up as usual and sat in his place. Devotees came for his darshan as usual.Baba put his Abhaya Hastha on their heads, blessed them and gave them udi prasad. Baba gave them necessary advice as per their need. They took them as usual advice which Baba used to give, but failed to think that they were Baba s last ones to them while in physical body. Baba asked Laxman Mama, who was an astrologer and devotee , to do God s Namasmaran for some time.
<br><br>
The time was 11 in the morning. <br>
Preparations were being made for noon Aarti. It appeared as if some divine light entered Baba. Aaarti was started. Throughout the Aarti Face of Baba was changing every moment. Those who looked at him had peace of mind and felt like looking at him continuously. During that period Baba appeared in different forms to the devotees present there. He appeared in the forms of Maruthi, Vittal, Dattatreya, Rama and to Muslim devotees as Mecca and Medina. For one Christian devotee, he appeared as Jesus. For Butty he appeared as Sri Krishna playing the flute in the Wada built by him.In this manner Baba, during aarti time, had shown his divine form to the devotees as per their thoughts.
Sai Baba Shirdi MahaSamadhiaarti was over. The time was one hour past noon. Baba ordered all the devotees to go away quickly.All of them went away to their houses. Suddenly Baba had a brutal cough and he vomited blood. There, Tatya the devotee of baba who was also fighting with death , recovered and his pulse came to normal. Some new strength entered his body. He stood up and could walk also. He cried out of joy. He could not understand from where he got this new power all of a sudden. The spectators were also surprised. Before he recovered from his surprise, he remembered Baba. Thinking that Baba had given him another lease of life, he went running to the mosque.
By that time Baba leaned on Baija Appaji Patil and was telling him something secretly. Saying this, he warned him not to reveal this to others, otherwise, he would die. Tatya heard these last words. Baba was getting severe cough and was heaving. Whenever he coughed, blood poured out through his mouth and fell all over Dwarakamai. Beforehand Baba had asked his devotees to be without fear and sent them for their meals. But a few devotees refused to leave Baba. When Tatya saluted Baba, he asked Shama to take Tatya and leave him in his house. Shama returned after leaving Tatya in his house.
<br><br>
Charity of Nine Rupees <br>
Lakshmi Bai Shinde and Bayyaji were the only ones remaining. She was near Baba s feet. Baba put his right hand in his shirt pocket twice, took out Rs.5 and Rs.4 and gave them as charity to Lakshmi Bai. Baba explained the significance of these nine rupees as the nine qualities a devotee should have (1)Absence of egoism (2) Absence of jealousy (3) Untiring service (4) Absence of worldly desires (5) Complete faith in Guru (6) Peaceful nature (7) Desire to know the truth (8) Absence of envy, and (9) Absence of self-boasting and finding faults in others. Unless a devotee improved these nine qualities, he could not have true devotion to reach God. Thus Baba taught to Lakshmi Bai even in his last moments.
<br><br>
Sai Baba  Mahasamadhi <br>
Dashami ended and Ekadashi came. The time was 2.30 in the afternoon. Sai Baba told Bayyaji that he was leaving this body and after his body was to be kept in Butty Wada.he would be protecting his devotees at all times. He breathed his last giving charity and teaching Jnana to his children. This is the way the king of yogis - Yogiraja - attained Samadhi. The divine light which came out of the body of Baba, joined Gurudhan, Dwarakamai and Venkusa, who were already in the form of divine lights (jyotis) and all the four jyotis combined into one as Sai divine power. It again divided into four parts. One part went to Gurusthan. The second part when to Chavadi and settled there. The third part merged in Dwarakamai, and the fourth part went into Butty Wada. These four powers represent the four Vedas. These are the proofs of Sai Power which can command and control the whole world. The Shivashakti from Kailash came and stayed in Shirdi. In this way Shirdi became a holy place. The body of Sai who exhibited supernatural powers and saved several devotees, was lying in Dwarakamai.
The physical body of Sai Baba, lying in Dwarakamai, cannot be seen again. So let us imagine ourselves to be in Dwarakamai and touch the holy feet of Sai Baba and make our life meaningful.
