   Of the Muslim devotees who came to Baba, the one about whom the greatest amount of information is available and who is revered by large numbers of Sai devotees is Abdul. Abdul is the one Muslim, who permanently attached himself to Baba for nearly thirty years during Baba’s life in the flesh and for thirty six years after Mahasamadhi, sticking on to Baba, and living upon the doles he got from the public.
   <br>
   Abdul was born in about 1871 and died in April 1954. He was a native of Nanded on the banks of Tapti. When he was very young, and under the care of Fakir Amiruddin of Nanded, Sai Baba appeared in the dream of that Fakir, and gave him two mangoes telling him to give the fruits to Abdul and send Abdul to Shirdi. Accordingly the Fakir told him of that dream, gave the fruits and directed him to go to Sai Baba of Shirdi. So, he came in his 20th year, about 1890, to Baba. At that time even Nana Saheb Chandorkar had not come to Baba. Baba welcomed him at Shirdi with these words: ‘Mera Kabla Ala’, that is, ‘My crow has come.’ Baba directed him to devote himself entirely to his service. So, his work was to feed the five perpetually burning oil lamps, such as those at the Lendi, the Masjid and the chavadi and to keep them lighted.

   The above file is a very precious translation of Abdul Baba's book where he would write down the words of Sai Baba. Later on in life he would use this to make predictions and they all came true. Another file is a brief Bio on Abdul Baba and how the notebook came into existence.

    <br>
   Below is a photograph of the original
    manuscript which is shared in the book Ambrosia in Shirdi by Dr Vinny Chitluri. She had access to the
     manuscript about 30 years ago where she was allowed to photograph it.

As for the food, at first Baba did not give him any food. Baba himself was going out begging and Abdul for himself. He lived at the stable near the Masjid. He was always by Baba’s side rendering service. He read the Koran sitting near Baba at the Mosque. Baba occasionally opened the Koran and made him read or rather recite passages at which he opened the book. He occasionally quotes passages from the Koran. Abdul went on writing down what Baba was saying, and Abdul had a note book in Marathi and Modi script which contain Baba’s utterances. That was Abdul’s Koran. Everything which fell from Baba’s lips is sacred and is enshrined in that book.
<br>
Abdul stuck on to Baba right up to the end, doing all menial and even scavenging services. After Baba passed away, he was the one Muslim in the establishment, and his work was to decorate the tomb of Baba, arrange the clothes and the flowers on it, and to receive first Prasad for his sustenance. As for his record note book he had got full faith that what Baba said was sufficient to guide him and every one. When anybody wanted to know about the future or about any problem and came to him, he consulted this book and the answer came out of the page opened. This proved to be effective. This is the gift of prophecy, which he got by Baba’s grace.
<br>
There are two instances of such prophetic consultation. In the Sai Mandir, a well was dug. The water proved salty. Baba was in Mahasamadhi at that time. So, Abdul consulted Baba’s book of sayings. The reply he got was, “If deeper the well is dug the water will become sweeter”. Accordingly the well was dug deeper by 2 feet, and the water was not salty.
<br>
Another instance was this: Barrister Gadgil wanted to know if his son would come back from England and where he would stay then. After consultation, Abdul Baba said, “He will return”. And so, he did return with his English wife and children. Abdul Baba used this manuscript book as his Koran. He used to go on reading reverently, got absorbed in it and rolled beads in his hands at the same time.
<br>
Nanda deepam or the perpetual lamp at the Lendi is now covered by a Pillar.  In 1936 when Abdul Baba was maintaining it, it was only a pit. There was nothing above to protect it, and on its four sides 20 pieces of cloth were tied and the hole was covered with zinc sheet. Baba used to sit behind that lamp and ordered him to fill up two pots with water and place them near him. Baba would pour out water in various directions from those pots. Why that was done, Abdul could not say, nor whether any mantra accompanied the action. Except Abdul no one else would be present when Baba scattered the water. Except Abdul Baba no other Mohammedan was reading the Koran or any other Holy book sitting by Baba’s side. Baba would occasionally utter sacred words. And all of them were noted in that book. By Baba’s order or permission, Abdul took them all down. This script is neither Devanagari nor Modi. Abdul used this book not merely for daily reading but also for prophecy. Abdul died in April 1954 and till then, he was in the establishment of the Sai Sansthan. Abdul had great faith in Baba, and would give udhi with Baba’s grace to many and help them achieving their objects such as cure of diseases. As he was for 66 years, worked either as the bodyguard of Baba or the attendant on his tomb, he is esteemed as the Hanuman of Baba; constantly attending on the Guru, never expecting any payment or reward, but simply out of faith sticking on to his master. His was noble example of complete and perfect devotion and active service with fullest faith that is Nishta in the Guru. He had both Shraddha and Saburi and Baba on occasions, told him that Abdul would live in storeyed houses and terraced houses and would have glorious time. Abdul lived for some time in Butiwada upstairs and he commanded the respect of a very wide circle of Hindus and Muslims.
<br><br>
My crow has come <br>
Abdul Baba was one of the muslim devotee who permanently attached himself to Sai Baba. Abdul Baba was one of the devotees who Baba personally called to serve him.
Baba wanted some persons to help him in his spiritual work, and we have already seen, they are Kaka Dixit, Das Ganu, Nana Saheb Chandorkar and he had also taken the responsibility of taking the devotees on new spiritual heights, one of the such devotees who was very close to Baba and who looked after Babas needs. Baba gave Abdul the following works
<br>
1. Keep the five lamps around Dwarakamai constantly filled with oil
<br>
2. Look after a lamp in Lendi Baug (protected by pieces of metal sheet and kept permanently lit by Baba)
<br>
3. Keep Dwarakamai and Chavadi clean by sweeping daily.
<br>
In addition, he swept the streets and removed “night soil” (human excreta). He fetched water from the river and washed Baba’s clothes daily.
<br>
So he was the servant in attendance to Baba. Baba called Abdul His crow. When Abdul Baba came, Baba welcomed him by saying “Mera Kabla Ala” or “My crow has come”. Baba personally wanted Abdul to come, so let us see how Baba called Him. Abdul was born in the year 1871 near Nanded. He was under the care of Fakir Amiruddin of Nanded. Sai Baba appeared in the dream of Amiruddin of Nanded and gave him two mangos and asked Abdul to be sent to Shirdi. Accordingly when the Fakir got up he found two mangos and giving the mangos to Abdul sent him to Shirdi. So we can see here that how much the fakir respected Sai Baba. He immediately complied with the request of Sai Baba.
<br>
Abdul Baba stayed near Baba and daily read the Koran sitting near Baba. Baba occasionally opened the Koran and Made him read or rather recite passages at which he opened the book. Baba also quoted passages from Koran and Abdul duly wrote them down in a book which he later extensively used for predictions.
<br>
Abdul Baba stuck to Sai Baba to the end doing all odd and menial works. After Babas passing away his work was to decorate the tomb of Baba, arrange clothes and flowers on it and receive the Prasad for his sustenance. His family still does the same seva to Baba even today.

<br>
So much trust Abdul Baba had in Sai Baba that when ever anyone came to Abdul Baba for guidance, Abdul Baba used to refer to his notes and give solutions. When the Shirdi Sansthan dug a well and the water turned brackish, Abdul Baba was consulted and Abdul Baba consulted the book and the reply got was to dig deeper and the well was dug deeper and the was sweet.

<br>
When Abdul Baba was maintaining Nanda Deep it was a small pit, not the Nanda Deep we seen today. On all the four sides about 20 pieces of cloth were tied and the hole was covered with a zinc. How tough it would have been for Abdul Baba to continuously keep the lamp burning 24 hours in heavy rains, chilly winds, and all vagaries of Nature. It is nothing but a sheer leela of Baba and the faith Abdul Baba had in Sai Baba.
<br>
If we think that for the services rendered Abdul Baba was paid by Sai Baba. Baba took the spiritual responsibility of Abdul Baba. No Sai Baba never gave any money or food to Abdul Baba and Abdul Baba had to beg for his survival. Later on Sai Baba started giving him food from the Prasad received.
<br>Abdul Babas services were washing clothes for Baba at the village stream, sweeping the mosque, chadavi and nearby places, lighting the lamps in these places, removing night soil from the way of Baba. And Sai Baba called him “Halalkoor (Scavenger)” and “My Mariambi”.
<br>
Abdul Baba later on started staying the place where Radha Krishna Mayi was staying and one day in the year 1927 the three walls of the building fell down, Abdul Baba was reciting Koran during that time and Abdul Baba was buried in the derbies. But Baba saved him and from any harm.
<br>
Baba has blessed Abdul Baba in many ways, like he said “Teruku, Dhariaku, Par Uttar Dhea” Tera Matti Sunna Banadiya “Kyabadi Madi Bandhya” “I have enabled you to cross the oceans, Your earth, i.e, mud body has been turned into gold.
<br>
Many references are made about Abdul Baba in Sai Satcharitra and even in Sai Satcharitra Baba called Abdul the crow.
<br>
After the 1918, till 1922, Abdul’s duties changed as he became the custodian of the shrine of Sai Baba after Sai Babas Samadhi in 1918. Abdul Babas responsibility was to clean, decorate the shrine with flowers, ritual offerings etc. Any food given as prasadam became his sustenance and he lived on the dakshina offered by Baba’s devotees.
<br>
In 1922, Kaka Dixit set up a Public Trust through the Ahmednagar District Court to administer the shrine. Persuaded by his well wishers, Abdul challenged the formation of the Trust and claimed that he was the legal heir to Sai Baba. He lost the case and consequently was debarred from having any connection with the maintenance of the shrine. He was refused free food and asked to vacate the room reserved for him in the shrine. Some time later, these severe restrictions were relaxed and Abdul Baba continued to play a role in the maintenance of the shrine till his death in April 1954.
<br>
Abdul Baba’s wife was Umranrao Bi and the couple had a son by name Abdul Pathan. The son was born in 1901 and passed away on 14 december 1984. Abdul Baba had five grandsons and two grand daughters. They are Ibrahim, Aziz, Rehman, Rahim and Hamid, Shamshad Bi and Irshad Bi. Only Rahim and Hamid are alive now. Abdul Babas Samadhi is in the Shirdi Sansthan Complex.
<br>
Baba used to give Abdul excellent advice fitting him for a yogi’s life. Baba used to advice him to eat very little and not to go for a variety of eatables. Baba also advised him not to sleep much. Abdul followed this advice. He kept awake all night, and in a kneeling posture kept repeating his Koran, that is, Baba’s words. He was meditating on them.
<br>
One night, Abdul was tired and  he tried to sleep, and held his palms in front of him to rest his drowsy head. Baba then said, ‘Are you trying to see the moon?’ That night when he fell asleep, he fell upon Baba and his gaddi. Baba gently stroked his feed, and then he awoke. The next day when he took water in his palms and looked at it, there was a big moon in that water. It was 2 p.m. This was what Baba had spoken of.
<br>
A zinc sheet was placed on the top of the pandal which protected the Lendi lamp. Twenty pieces of curtain cloth were tied all round the lamp to form something like a tent round it, and Abdul looked after the lamp, which was in the centre. That light has been shifted from its place now and is put inside a raised pillar of brick and mortar, containing a chamber for the lamp. Baba would get up from near the lamp and walk a few yards in each direction gazing intently into the distance evidently supervising with a parental eye the devotees in each of those directions.
<br>
Abdul’s services were washing clothes in the streamlet at the village boundary, sweeping the Mosque, the chavadi and the surrounding places, lighting the lamps in these buildings, feeding them with oil and sweeping the village streets and removing the night soil from the way of Baba. That was why Baba called him, Halalkoor and ‘My Mirambi’. He fetched water and also engaged himself in sundry services. Baba protected Abdul by providing him with food and ensured his safety and progress. About 1927, that is, 11 years after Ramakrishna Ayi’s death, in the Sala, which she had occupied Abdul was once reciting the Koran. Suddenly three walls of that dilapidated mud building collapsed, and Abdul was buried waist deep in the debris. But Baba saved him from harm.
<br>
Abdul’s first Guru later on came to Shirdi and wanted him to go back from Shirdi. But Abdul pleaded that nothing could be done without Baba’s permission. Baba not having given the permission, the former Guru went away from Shirdi.
<br>
Baba sometimes used to give blessings concealing them under abuse and violence. Baba beat Abdul and Jog many times. Abdul had various blessings and prophecies, and Baba sat with Abdul at the chavadi in the morning before he started for the Mosque. Abdul’s statement about Avatars, his book shows, has reference to all the Dasa Avatars, and there is a hint that Baba treated himself as one of the avatars. Baba also prophesied that the British Empire in India would have only nine rulers in India. In 1947, evidently at the time of the ninth king, India passed out of British jurisdiction.
<br>
Abdul Baba's Samadhi is situated inside Shirdi Sai Baba Temple Complex. This is the first Samadhi to your right opposite to the Museum on the way to Lendi Bagh.

Abdul Baba's  cottage is in front of the Chavadi. Abdul Baba was conferred the title of Sultan and was called Chotu Sultan of Nanded Village. He was married to Umran Bi and had a son. Abdul was serving Amiruddin Baba and following a dream vision, Amiruddin sent him to Shirdi. In Shirdi he worked as a Sevak doing all sorts of menial jobs. As he did not have any income he begged for his food. He strictly followed Baba’s instructions of “Eat very little and sleep very little”.
<br><img src="{% static "images/abdul4.jpg" %}" alt="baba" width="200" height="260"> <br>
He slept wherever he could. Then he built a small mud house where his cottage now stands. When the Sansthan was formed they leased this land and cottage to him. He kept busy looking after Baba’s Samadhi.

<br>
The devotees, who visit his cottage have an opportunity to venerate the Chimta (Prongs). It is said that it was given to him by Baba. Abdul treasured it and venerated it daily with Loban (incense). After Baba’s Mahasamadhi, Abdul used this for curing the pains and ailments of devotees. One can have darshan of the original photographs of Baba that are hung on the left wall.
<br>
Baba is also said to have given him a Satka and a Tin Mug.  But we devotees should be most grateful to Abdul Baba for writing down the sayings, teachings and parables of Baba in a notebook. He read them daily like a Koran.
<br><img src="{% static "images/abdul8.jpg" %}" alt="baba" width="200" height="260"> <br>
His descendant Ghani Bhai is given the honour of doing the Alankar Baba’s Samadhi every day at 10 A.M. The Samadhi is cleaned and a floral arrangement is done.
<br>
Abdul Baba's Grandson Hamid Baba is continuing the legacy of Abdul Baba even to this day.
