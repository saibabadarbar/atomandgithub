   Lakshmi Bai hailed from a village near Yeola. At the tender age of thirteen, she married Tukaram Patil Shinde, and came to Shirdi. She had two sons named Tatya and Nana. Lakshmi Bai Shinde's husband was a Revenue Officer, and the British had conferred the title of "Mulki Patil" (village officer) on him.
<br>
   She was widowed at a very young age, so all the responsibility fell on her young shoulders. Lakshmibai looked after her children, her farmland, and undertook the job of Mulki Patil. Meticulously she collected taxes and deposited it at the office at Ragoba Dada Wada (building's name). The British were very pleased with her dedication and gave her a stipend. Lakshmi Bai was a well-to-do woman. She owned her own home (Ref: Shri.Arun Gaikwad, "Sai Baba Vishesh Ank)
<br>
   Lakshmi Bai was working in the Masjid day and night. Except Bhagat Mhalasapati, Tatya and Lakshmibai, none was allowed to step in the Masjid at night. Once while Baba was sitting in the Masjid with Tatya in the evening, Lakshmibai came and saluted Baba. The latter said to her - "Oh Lakshmi, Iam very hungry." Off she went saying- "Baba, wait a bit, I return immediately with bread." She did return with bread and vegetables and placed the same before Baba. He took it up and gave it to a dog. Lakshmibai then asked - "What is this, Baba, I ran in haste, prepared bread with my own hands for You and You threw it to a dog without eating a morsel of it; You gave me trouble unnecessarily." Baba replied - "Why do you grieve for nothing? The appeasement of the dog's hunger is the same as Mine. The dog has got a soul; the creatures may be different, but the hunger of all is the same, though some speak and others are dumb. Know for certain, that he who feeds the hungry, really serves Me with food. Regard this as an exiomatic Truth." This is a ordinary incident but Baba thereby propounded a great spiritual truth and showed its practical application in daily life without hurting anybody's feelings. From this time onward Lakshmibai began to offer Him daily bread and milk with love and devotion. Baba accepted and ate it appreciatingly. He took a part of this and sent the remainder with Lakshmibai to Radha- Krishna-Mai who always relished and ate Baba's remnant prasad. This bread-story should not be considered as a digression; it shows, how Sai Baba pervaded all the creatures and and transcended them. He is omnipresent, birthless, deathless and immortal.(Ref: Shri Sai Satcharitra Chapter 42). After this incident Lakshmi Bai often brought Bhakar and milk with which she lovingly fed Baba.

   (She served Baba for about 45 years. At the time of  his Mahasamadhi,  Baba  gave  her  9  silver coins  of  British Era, representing  9  types  of devotion to God.)

   Lakshmibai Shinde was a well to do woman. Her full name is Lakshmibai Tukaram Shinde. Bhagoji Shinde was her husband’s uncle. She used to prepare food for Baba every day. She had, during her entire life time, served Baba during day and night with utmost devotion and unswerving faith. Baba used to address her as “Laxmi Ma”. She was allowed access into the masjid at all times including nights, similar to the privilege granted to Mhalasapati and Tatya Patil. She was the only woman who was allowed to go into the masjid when the curtain was down (in those days the curtain acted as a door and covered the upper portion of the masjid) and at that time no body was allowed inside the masjid.

   Once, in the evening, as usual Baba was reclining against the wall and chatting with Tatya Patil. Laxmibai came there and bowed down before him. Baba said, “Laxmibai ! I am very hungry.”  Laxmibai rushed to her home and gladly prepared rotis etc. immediately and brought that hot food to Baba. Baba picked up the plate of the hot food and placed it before a hungry dog. Laxmibai was surprised to see this. She immediately said, “Baba, I hurriedly cooked the food for you; but you gave it to the dog. You did not even taste a morsel.” Baba replied, “Laxmibai, there is God in every being. If your food enters any mouth that is hungry, be assured that it has fallen into my own mouth.” Thus, Baba indicated to Laxmibai that feeding any hungry animal was feeding him. From that day onwards, Laxmibai started bringing rotis etc. for Baba. She mixed it with milk and with great love brought it to Baba. Baba on his part also waited for her rotis to come and did not touch any other food before her food arrived. On some occasions, the food from her would come late even though everyone in the masjid would be feeling very hungry. But, still Baba would not start his meals till Laxmibai’s food arrived. After some period, Baba started demanding kheer (sweet) made from Shevaya from her. After Laxmibai brought such type of kheer, Baba would ask her to sit by his side. He then used to taste a little and was sending the remaining food to Radhakrishnamai . She served Baba for about 45 years. Baba used to give her daily four rupees.

   Lakshmi Bai's house is on the left side of the lane that goes from the Dwarakamai to Tajin Khan's Darga.

   Lakshmi Bai’s Statue
<br>
   Inside the house is a small shrine with Lakshmi Bai’s statue, in front of which are the nine coins enclosed in a glass top box. On Vijayadashmi day in the year 1918 before Baba took Mahasamadhi, he put His hand in His pocket and gave her Rs.5/- then Rs.4/- totaling Rs.9/- indicative of nine types of devotion namely Shravana, Kirtana, Smarana, Charana Sevana, Archana, Vandana, Dasya, Sakhya and Atma Nivedana. (Ref: Shri Sai Satcharitra Chapter 21 and Chapter 42).
<br>
   Another Interpretation of 9 Coins could be as follows: The number 5 could be the "Panch Indiriyas". They are the "Karmendriyas" and there are 5 "Jnanendriyas". These Indriyas are the casue of Joy and Sorrow. The 4 rupees could also mean the "Ego Complex" that is Manas, Buddhi, Aham and Chitta.
<br>
   If the above mentioned are placed in Baba's hands or lay at His feet, It is "Total Sharanagati" or "Total Surrender". Baba through Lakshmi Bai is teaching us to totally surrender ourselves to Him.
<br>

Laxmibai brought meal for Baba, which was his last supper on 15th October, 1918. Lakshmibai Shinde was one of the seven devotees who were present with Baba in the masjid when Baba passed away into Mahasamadhi. Baba gave her first five silver coins and then four silver coins, total 9 (nine) silver coins of British Era. All were very much surprised to know as to how Baba got those silver coins of British Era and how he preserved them. They knew that Baba did not keep any thing with him. Thus as to how and from where Baba had got these 9 silver coins, had become a mystery. Some people felt that those nine coins would symbolize the nine forms of devotion and others viewed them as the nine characteristics of a good disciple.
<br>

When Baba’s Marble Statue, sculpted by B.V.Talim, the celebrated sculptor of Bombay, was brought to Shirdi before installation, Laxmibai Shinde was one of the few living devotees who saw the Statue of Baba and expressed happily that the Statue looked like Baba exactly and felt that Baba came back to Shirdi in the form of Life-Like Statue. She was also lucky to observe the installation ceremony of Baba’s Statue at the hands of Sri Sai Sharananandji in the Samadhi Mandir on 7th Oct, 1954, the Vijayadasami day, exactly 36 years after Baba’s Mahasamadhi.
<br>
She lived for 115 years upto 1963 and passed away on 2nd June, 1963 which was an Ekadasi day. The nine coins were kept with the statue of Laxmibai in the small house which is open to the public for darshan.

   Lakshmi Bai’s Samadhi <br>

   Lakshmi Bai Shinde took Samadhi on 2nd June 1963. She died peacefully after Shej Aarti. Prior to her demise, she asked her relatives to read aloud Chapter 42 of the holy Shri Sai Satcharitra (Ref: Shri.Arun Gaikwad, Sai Baba Vishesh Ank). The Samadhi of Lakshmi Bai is in front of her home. It is enclosed in a small shrine.

   Lakshmi Bai Samadhi Outerview
<br>
 In 2009, her descendants, had removed the old shrine and Samadhi as they propsed to build a grand shrine and Samadhi.
<br>
   Lakshmi Bai Shinde's descendants are still living in that house.

   <br>
   The house with her Samadhi in front, is located a few metres near the Chavadi. In 1963, Laxmibai handed over these divine coins to her daughter-in-law, Sonubai who performed puja for these coins from the year 1963 to 1984 in the house. Later these coins were handed over to her son. Afterwards the coins were handed over to her fifth generation of descendants. Thus the coins are moving from one generation to another and her descendants are keeping them as a treasure. All the family members from generation to generation, were happy and did not have any financial problems and on the other hand they were financially well off through Baba’s Grace.
<br>
   Even now Laxmibai Shinde’s descendants have preserved these 9 coins very carefully and they shine now in the same way as they were when Baba had given them to Laxmibai. It was a fact that when Baba had come to Shirdi for the first time, it was Laxmibai only who had offered food to Baba. Baba had given the coins to Laxmibai perhaps in recognition of her sincere service and unswerving devotion and faith. Now many devotees visit their house for the darshan of these 9 blessed coins and it is believed that just by the mere darshan of these 9 coins, one’s problems get solved. Baba perhaps preserved these coins and gave to ankita devotee, Lakshmibai Shinde before he went to Mahasamadhi. Such was her devotion towards Baba.
